I have always had fairly high end desktop computers - always with Intel (where I once worked) and Nvidia (with which I worked) processors. I continually upgrade motherboards, CPU's and graphics boards, something that can't be done with laptops. Recently I have been looking for a laptop computer that I would find useful with a limited budget and, at $800, it is difficult to imagine a better bargain than this Dell Inspiron i7559-763. I made a leap of faith and ordered this computer before it was even released - something I have never before done. So far it has been fast and reliable, and I am definitely happy with my decision. It even runs cool and quiet. Other high points for me are:  - Intel i5-6300HQ processor - Nvidia GTX 960M GPU - Bright, sharp IPS screen - Backlit keyboard - SSD  When I received this laptop I discovered another feature that I definitely appreciate. There is a large hatch on the bottom of the computer that can be opened with a single screw (and without breaking any seals). This hatch provides easy access to the memory and AN EMPTY SLOT FOR A DISK DRIVE WITH A CONNECTOR CABLE WAITING! The only hesitancy I had about the features of this computer was the limited storage space on the included SSD (i.e. 256GB) but that is now a non-issue with the easy addition of another SSD in the future. I even temporarily installed a 2.5 inch HD I had lying around and verified it would work. There also appears to be an empty slot for another memory card but I did not test it.  One feature I didn't test well is the touchpad. All touchpads are beneath contempt to me so I always use a mouse.  So far this is a great computer and I definitely recommend it.
