Review 1,"I love this keyboard.First off, this is a long review. That is because I really want to help anyone with making a decision on this and I enjoy being thorough, fair and honest in my reviews.To give myself some credibility in this review, I am a pianist and would put myself somewhere around the intermediate level. I've had maybe a couple months of lessons (around 5 years ago) and the rest has been self taught. I always practiced on a baby grand Baldwin piano that my mother owns. Now that I have been out of the house for years and only playing upon visits or where I could find an open piano, I decided I needed to invest in a piano.Pianos themselves are far too expensive and big for what I can afford now so a keyboard was the right choice for me. However... I hated keyboards. I hated the plastic keys and more than that I hated only having SOME of the keys. So I did a lot of research online to find if there was anything I could afford and be happy with. And then I found the Williams Legato keyboard and it had 88 keys! Not only that, the keys were semi-weighted and velocity sensitive (I could play soft, loud and anywhere in between). Then I see that the listed price is only around $200 while some other keyboards with 56-61 keys were going for roughly the same price. Then I read some reviews, listened to it's sound on YouTube and that basically did it for me. Other keyboards do have other features such as more sounds and other fun things you can do like recording, changing pitch, playing with background beat and so on. However, I don't care much for those although I know I would have fun with them.The Williams Legato 88-Key Digital Pianos is an outstanding piano. I've owned it for a while now and I couldn't be happier. It has all the keys I wanted ( which I needed to play some of the songs I know) and although any keyboard like this will never be the same as a real piano - I am very happy with it. The weighted, force sensitive keys added that satisfaction that I really wanted. The quality of sound from the piano does seem to vary based on opinion; I will agree that it does not get very loud but I think the quality of the sound itself is excellent. The velocity sensitive feature works really well and makes the difference between playing a song and playing a song with feeling. Being able to use headphones is so great in many ways. I do have fun with the few different sounds it has (Electric Piano, Organ, Synth, Bass) and being able to layer them. However, all I really care about is sounding like a piano and I think it certainly does its part. I wanted a keyboard that sounds and feels like a really piano and I am very satisfied.I am not very savvy with other aspects of electronic music such as hooking it up to an amplifier, hooking it up to your computer for recording..etc. This keyboard has those features but I'm not a reliable source for the quality it has in those areas.I am really really disappointed in some of these other reviews that docked off so many stars because it didn't come with a power cord... I understand that frustration and I myself find it very odd and upsetting that it doesn't come with it's own source of power. But if you check anywhere else (williamspiano.com musiciansfriend.com, guitarcenter.com) you will see that it is listed there. So I don't want that to be a surprise for anyone - I knew about it myself before I bought it.I did not buy the essentials pack for a couple reasons:1. I already have high quality headphones.2. I was almost positive that the sustain pedal would be cheap.3. I was confident I could find the power cord elsewhere and for way cheap.I bought the M-Audio SP-2 Sustain Pedal which I absolutely love. (You can read my review for that)The power cord I found at the DI (Deseret Industries) which is basically like a Goodwill. So they have old electronics parts and I found a 12VDC power adapter that was the right size and it was $2. (I still use it, it works and haven't had any issues yet. You can't just go out and get a power cord. You have to be very careful about finding the right one. Maybe I'll add insight and details on that at a later time. Research AC-DC adapters and polarity if you wish to understand.)I bought a 1/8"" to 1/4"" stereo adapter for my headphones and the piano sounds AMAZING with my headphones. That feature in general is amazing cause now people don't have to get all ""annoyed"" when I practice because they won't here it - only me and it allows me to feel immersed in the sound. You can find that adapter at RadioShack (where I got mine) for $5 and here on amazon where you might get it for a dollar cheaper.I was also able to find one of those foldable piano stands at the same DI (Deseret Industries) for $3. (I would consider that extremely lucky - it was the only one in the store)However..... finding all of these separately was a bit of a hassle. So if your not interested in the hassle, the Essentials Pack sounds good enough but I am confident, judging by reviews on it, that what I have is higher quality. Finding good quality, longer lasting products is very important to me but whether or not that matters to you is for you to decide.If you are looking for an electric keyboard that's overall cheaper and has other fun features maybe Casio would be the way to go. If you want a good keyboard to practice on for the real thing, this is the way to go!I really hope this review helps - I'd be so happy to answer questions."
Review 2,"I received the headphones today. Product works right out of the box. I really like the look and the feel of the these earbuds. The piece that goes over the ear is very flexible which can make it clumsy at first, but very comfortable. It also comes with multiple inner ear pieces. It took me several tries but I found the right fit for both ears, and they were totally different sizes ! I really enjoyed the ability to customize my fit. The sound has PLENTY of bass which was important to my taste but also has a good sound level. I paired it with my phone and my Ipod Nano very easily. I will start the real test tomorow during running and working out. I will also update as to how long they last, play time, etc. Good first impression! I received the headphones today.

Review 3,"I  purchased this for my husband as a gift. He's only used them for 4 1/2 months, and just recently broke the housing while changing out the rubber ear pads. (See photo) They actually come with three or four different sizes so you can customize them. Great idea, right?! Wrong!! My husband took them to the closest Beats dealer/warranty service provider immediately. It turned out to be the Apple store. They looked up the warranty, and said that this repair was not covered. If he wanted to have it repaired, it would cost $164 plus tax. That's it. For that cost we could buy a new pair, but we're not. It's obviously very fragile and they are aware of this because it's specifically not covered. Buyer beware! "
Review 4,"purchased a pair of these in-walls for a pool table/game room area I am building in the basement. My receiver is an Onkyo 805 7.1 home theater system and these will serve as stereo/audio part for only that room. I have never owned Polks or in wall speakers for that matter and listened to them at the big box store before purchasing these through Amazon. I was really impressed at the audio quality. I also didn't want floor standing speakers, but didn't want to sacrifice audio quality either so these speakers filled the bill._No back boxes are necessary, the speaker is designed as an ""infinite_baffle"" type and only requires that the front and rear moving sound wave_are isolated from each other. Polk recommends to maximize the sound quality, you place a modest amount of a sound absorbing material, such as Polyfil (a synthetic cotton-like material found at craft/fabric stores) inside the cavity before installing the speakers. Supposedly, this will absorb the rear moving sound wave and reduce mid range coloration. I think insulation also works just as well. I haven't done this yet and they still sound excellent!"
Review 5,"IÕm going to start this review with full disclosure: I am more of an Apple guy than an Samsung guy. So, this review has the potential to a little biased. With that said, I did try to maintain an objective opinion about this phone and used it daily for a couple of weeks before writing this review._Design_If design were the only criteria for this review, the Samsung Galaxy S6 would get 5 Stars. However, it seems that Samsung was ÔinspiredÕ by the iPhone 6 design and IÕm a big fan of that style. In all fairness to Samsung, this is not a cheap knockoff of an Apple product. The phone feels nice in your hand and it is well made. One thing that I dislike about the S6 is how large the camera lens area is on the back of the phone. I tend to have my index finger in that area when making a call and it makes the S6 feel more bulky than it actually is.__Screen_The screen on the S6 is lovely. ItÕs main display resolution is 2560 x 1440 (Quad HD), which compares to the iPhone 6 with 1334_750 Retina HD display. Its color is very bright and is definitely on par with the iPhone 6 in my opinion. I found the touch screen to be responsive and saw no performance issues while using the phone throughout the day._Camera_I hate to admit it, but I think this phone in general takes more crisp pictures than my iPhone 6. Sometimes more megapixels and the quality of the image sensor matter and it looks like Samsung found a nice paring for the S6. The Galaxy S6Õs camera has an impressive 16MP, while the iPhone 6 has an 8-megapixel iSight camera.__Software_Because this is the latest and greatest hardware from Samsung, it runs comes equipped with Android 5.0 Ð Lollipop. ItÕs important to point out that the phone used for this review was a Verizon device. So, this was not stock Android. However, after personally experiencing some nightmares with bloatware installed on Verizon phones, I can honestly say it is not too bad on the S6. The one thing that did irritate me is that the default messaging app is Verizon Messenger. But, this can, of course, be changed. I have read online that it is possible to install stock Android on the Verizon S6 if one desired to do so, but we did not test this.__Using the S6_The S6 was pretty intuitive. If you have used Android before, it will be easy to find your way around because the bloatware is limited and the nuts and bolts are pretty similar to a stock Android experience. Call quality was great and I experienced no issues with connection speed on WIFI or Verizon 4G._Final Thoughts_If youÕre in the market for a new Android phone, the Samsung Galaxy S6 is probably one of the best Android phones on the market right now. ItÕs fast and offers a solid alternative to AppleÕs iPhones.__This product was received at a free or discounted price in exchange for this review. I am a technology journalist and pride myself on providing fair and honest reviews. Please feel free to ask any questions you might have."
Review 6,"I purchased this TV to be a small bedroom TV. Within 48 hours of owning it, I wanted to sell our large living room TV and replace it with a Roku TV.__I have started recommending Roku TVs to anyone without cable/satellite. You only need one remote, and everything just works. (I have a universal remote for my other TV, and I'm fine with it, but other household members are not, and we all prefer the Roku tv/remote to the universal)__The only minor complaint that I have is that there are no numbers on the remote for switching TV channels. It's only minor because pressing left or right on the remote brings up the channel list, and then you can quickly get to the channel that you want. "
Review 7,"We have had this TV for a couple of weeks. Since we donÕt subscribe to cable, we mostly watch local news and occasionally local sport. We also have Amazon Prime and watch the odd free movie or rent one to watch on my computer monitor.__So when it came time to purchase a new TV we approached it the same way we approached buying a house. We made a list of the features we wanted (a SmartTV with Wifi, streaming channels, Amazon Prime, at least 50Ó and affordable at around the $500 mark). After looking at our options in terms of price and convenience, we decided that it made the most sense to purchase it through Amazon Prime.__After much research, we decided that the TCL TVÕs offered the best value, met our budget requirements, and our decision to purchase the TV through Amazon enabled us to purchase the TV with interest free financing over 6 months.__Appearance.__The TV came in a large box with the stand hardware: remote, power cable and batteries plus simple instructions that were in separate bags. You do not get a HDMI or any other cables. The TV has a simple non-fussy design with approximately half inch bezel all around. The stand that comes with it is simple and screws on with two screws at each side. The stand footprint requires about 8.5 inches of depth to stand on which was perfect for the 11 inch thick mantle over our fireplace. (NOTE: We donÕt actually use the fireplace and heat could potentially damage the TV) I like that the stand is low profile raising the screen about 2Ó above the surface it is standing on. This leaves a small gap for low profile devices like our WD live media hub and remotes, while also hiding most of the cables and extension chord."
Review 8,"I'm a headphone junkie so I have a good collection of all types of headphones. Sound is still subjective, but I know if something sounds ""good"". That being said, these are a definite upgrade from any headphone of the previous line of beats. Why it took so long for good sound, is beyond me. But these definitely sound good for nearly every genre of music. Now, its not going to rival open back headphones for sound stage, but most closed back headphones wont anyway. The price is for sure a bit steep, but they are definitely a step up sound wise, look good and the special editions have metalic type bands, which equate to good build quality. Beats headphones are polarizing and I hated the old line (most specifically the studios which sounded like complete garbage) but this new line up definitely sounds good, not just in comparison to the old line, but in general. Definitely give em a shot if you have the cash and looking for some flash."
Review 9,"I'm a long-time Tracfone user who recently upgraded from a LG 800G. This phone is more modern looking, well built, and has wi-fi and a greatly improved touch screen. If you connect by wi-fi, the phone won't use up your minutes when you're on the web. It's priced lower than the Android phones now supported by Tracfone. It is not a smart phone since it doesn't run Android apps, but it does the job of light web browsing and email and facebook checking pretty well. My phone works with good network coverage, but you should check with which network your phone would connect before you buy, because this can vary with a new phone. There are other apps available (paid from Tracfone, free at other online sites) if you want to play more games and such. It's smaller than the current smart phones, but the screen size is ok for my needs. Another great feature is that the ""triple minutes for life"" works for calls, texts, and data. There's a very helpful e-book by Craig C. White written about the LG 840G available from Amazon (also applicable to this phone) that gives you some great tips and info that I recommend. "
Review 10,"I have always had fairly high end desktop computers - always with Intel (where I once worked) and Nvidia (with which I worked) processors. I continually upgrade motherboards, CPU's and graphics boards, something that can't be done with laptops. Recently I have been looking for a laptop computer that I would find useful with a limited budget and, at $800, it is difficult to imagine a better bargain than this Dell Inspiron i7559-763. I made a leap of faith and ordered this computer before it was even released - something I have never before done. So far it has been fast and reliable, and I am definitely happy with my decision. It even runs cool and quiet. Other high points for me are:__- Intel i5-6300HQ processor_- Nvidia GTX 960M GPU_- Bright, sharp IPS screen_- Backlit keyboard_- SSD__When I received this laptop I discovered another feature that I definitely appreciate. There is a large hatch on the bottom of the computer that can be opened with a single screw (and without breaking any seals). This hatch provides easy access to the memory and AN EMPTY SLOT FOR A DISK DRIVE WITH A CONNECTOR CABLE WAITING! The only hesitancy I had about the features of this computer was the limited storage space on the included SSD (i.e. 256GB) but that is now a non-issue with the easy addition of another SSD in the future. I even temporarily installed a 2.5 inch HD I had lying around and verified it would work. There also appears to be an empty slot for another memory card but I did not test it.__One feature I didn't test well is the touchpad. All touchpads are beneath contempt to me so I always use a mouse.__So far this is a great computer and I definitely recommend it. "
Review 11,"Received the Blaze after a direct preorder from Fitbit.__Best Fitbit I've had yet. I was wearing both an Apple Watch (for the smart functions) and a Charge HR since the Apple Watch is horrible at tracking fitness. Well now I've ditched the Apple Watch and my arm is finally free! :)__All I really wanted was text notifications, and the Blaze does that very well. Easy interface, just swipe up for notifcations, and back down to go back to the home screen. The user interface is extremely easy. Just swipe to the left for ""Today"" where you can see all your typical stats (steps, heartrate, distance, calories, flights), or keep swiping to select exercise you're about to do, FitStar, Timer, Alarms, or settings.__Screen is bright and colorful. No noticeable lag. You can also update the watch face to constantly display your steps and whatnot (I chose the display with the date).__Super easy to set up. Add device in the app, get an update, and you're off. Nothing more to it. Stats carry over (as I was wearing the Charge HR in the morning and received the Blaze in the afternoon).__Don't believe the hype over ""how big"" it is. Yes, it has a larger footprint than the Apple Watch, but it's thinner and fits your wrist better. Not to mention it is much lighter. Shirt sleeves go on easy over it, as opposed to getting snagged on bulkier smart watches.__Heart rate monitoring seems to be much better than the Charge HR (despite possibly having the same sensors, a software upgrade perhaps?).__Great device so far. Will certainly update if I run into any issues."
Review 12,"For my needs these speakers sound absolutely amazing. I am a bit of an audiophile and partially deaf. I am a contractor and decided to build my own jobsite stereo and these did just the trick. The sound out of these little guys is absolutely impressive!! Keep in mind that speakers will always sound different in different vehicles and applications, so your experience will be different than mine. I built wood boxes behind mine to give them the perfect amount of air space and added a 6.5 mid low sub to the rear. Using a high pass filter I killed the bass on these so I could obtain a clear sound at higher volumes. If you know what you are doing and you are lacking space for larger speakers, these are completely amazing and worth every penny! "
Review 13,"I have bought a lot of very expensive amps that arent built as well as this one, specially for the price. All the connections are well laid out, all the controls are easily adjusted, the body is well built and very clean looking. The manual is very well written and easily understood with a lot more info than a lot of higher priced models. I have been running this amp bridged at 2 Ohms for a week now, it has performed flawlessly without overheating even once, I have it mounted in a pretty tight area that doesnt get much air circulation, in fact I had an MTX amp mounted in the same spot and it would constantly overheat and go into protection. As far as sound quality goes it sounds very good! No noise, very clean and solid bass, I am able to play it far louder than the MTX and Rockford Fosgate it replaced, it actually sounds like it was made to listen to not just to make speakers go boom. I listen to music not Rap and it sounds very smooth no matter what I play. Drums sound like drums, bass guitars sound like guitars not like a horrible low frequency buzz. I was so happy with the quality that I bought a SSL EV4.400 four channel amp for my mids and tweets, I also bought a SSL S4EQ to control everything. If these units last a month with the punishment I give them I will be buying more SSL products. It's nice to know someone makes a quality amp that doesnt cost a fortune! I wouldnt hesitate to recomend this amp to anyone looking for a quality product at a very good price! "
Review 14,"I have been shopping around for a new amp, after my old one die on me. I am extremely picky about my sound and was a little skeptical about buying this amp. You get what you paid for. I am using it with one 15"" Kicker sub woofer, the amp is bridged to maximize the power output. Needless to say it hit hard. It sound better then my old MTX amp. It provide a deeper base and also a more lucid voice output if set to low pass filter. My only problem was the remote wire was not working at first, but that was my fault. I contact Sound Storm customer support and got a respond the same day. In order for the remote button to work. The amp have to be set to low pass filter. not high pass, nor full range.__**Update February 12 2013***_Just upgraded from one 15"" Kicker to now two twelves's inch Kickers. it sound absolutely amazing at one 1000 watts. My freind have 2000 watts amp and honestly can sat my baby 1000 watts outshine his system.__IT IS WORTH THE MONEY, I RECOMMEND IT."
Review 15,"I am a full out working mom who never stops, and normally have earbuds in my ear the majority of the day. Luckily I have a job where I'm not dealing with the public, and my boss is cool, so I'm able to have my earbuds in all around the office. That being said, my line of work includes a lot of walking around the office, getting up constantly from my desk, and having earbuds that plug into your cell phone is definitely annoying when you're filing, and they get stuck around an open drawer and are ripped out of your ears. Ow. So I did order a multitude of cheap to high dollar wireless earbuds that all sucked. I did buy one pair that was pretty decent, but my husband managed to steal those for when he's fishing so he doesn't loose his expensive pair of wireless earbuds. So I, in turn, stole his expensive wireless earbuds. And I had a love hate relationship with them. The battery did not last long, so I was constantly charging it, and I found they hurt my ears after continued use even with changed up the earbuds.__So when I came across the Bose SoundSport earbuds, I went ahead and got them hoping they would be better than my husbands. I can happily say that after a full day of use I think I might be in love with a non animate object.__When you open the package you'll find the Bose earbuds with the medium earbuds on it, and under the plastic housing the earbuds you'll find the small and large earbuds, a USB cable for charging, and an awesome round case for storage that has a great big clip on it to attach to a bag, purse, etc. As soon as I opened it, I went ahead and started charging the wireless earbuds, hoping they'll be ready for my lunch hour workout, and in less than two hours the red light turned green, and the battery was fully charged. So it has a very small amount of charge time, which is great as, again, I use them all day. The light also changes from red, which is no charge at all, to yellow, which is charging, and finally to green for a full charge. What I also love about charging these is that they have a little battery door on the right earbud on the side of it. My husbands expensive ones had the charging port under the earpiece, and I had to pull off the earbud to get to it, and it was so very easy to loose the earbud.__Once I was done charging, I downloaded the Bose app to my phone just in case I needed it, and with my Bluetooth on, pressed down on the power button for two seconds. It came up immediately on my phone, and after just a second was synced and ready to go! I did open the app to see what that was about, and from it you can change a few setting features, such as when the wireless earbuds go to sleep mode. I left it on 20 minutes, which is what it's automatically set to. Other than that the app features settings where you can name your earbuds (I choose, Hands Off Husband), change the language, take off the voice prompts, see a user manual, and manage which devices the earbuds are paired to.__After those settings are done, you are all set! I popped these in my ear testing the size and fit, and I'm a very small female, and the medium was perfect for me. The control buttons are very close to your right ear, like right underneath for ease of use, but if your hair is down I found the control kind of got lost in all my hair. I do like the fact that the back of the control area is hard plastic, and the buttons are soft silicone, and I also found the raised volume buttons to be very user friendly and easy to find. The middle portion of the control features the play, pause, and skip button. One press for starting your music, another press for pausing, and two presses for skipping. You can also answer the phone by pressing on this button to or end the call. The only issue I had there is from my cell phone in answering a call. I had to change it to the Bose earbuds as even though I pressed the central button to answer the call, it still went to my cell phones speakers. When you receive a call the earbuds also speak the number and the persons name if you have it saved, which is great.__In listening to my audio books or music, Bose definitely lives up to its name! Just wow! I listened to music with deep bass, just to see how it would sound...oh my word. It literally vibrated my ears that's how deep the bass is! Amazing! The sound is so incredible, and makes my husbands expensive one's seem like the cheapest one's on the market. And they were more expensive than these! With these in your ear, they aren't fully noise cancelling, but they do a very good job of keeping out other noise!__I also went to the gym with these on, and used the attached clip to clip it to my workout shirt, and I did a full workout, including running, and these never once moved in my ears! They stayed put with ease! They aren't uncomfortable at all, and I literally had the right earbud in my ear from 11:30 in the morning to 7 that evening, and I had no pain in my ear at all! Super comfortable! As for the battery life of that time frame...I had FIFTY percent still left in my earbuds after using them from listening to music, audio books, talking, or in sleep mode. I forgot to power them off last night, and I had forty percent left this morning!! Great freaking battery life on these!__These are by far the best wireless earbuds I've used to date! They are comfortable, easy to use, the battery life is fantastic, and the sound quality is beyond superb! My husband is currently eyeing them with keen interest, so we might have to order him a pair."
Review 16,"I bought these in store in Sony's store front in San Diego, CA. I have had Bose OTH headphones for over a decade now. 2 pairs in two different versions. They were good but listening to these and several others in the Sony line in store it's apparent that Sony has seriously upped its game._So here is my review.__Physically the headphones feel sturdy and have good mass. The ear pads are very thick, I tried on every pair of headphones in the store from the $500 Hi Res Audio all the way down and I personally thought these were more comfortable and produced a better sound. The only con as another poster said is they do not include a carry bag, all my Bose have come with carrying cases. Not worth a star reduction but I would like to have had a pouch for them.__Comparing these with my BOSE AE2, these blow my BOSE Over the Ear headphones out of the water. The sound is better, deeper, richer.__The bass response is definitely richer, I felt like with even some of the other Sony models even there was a wall or ceiling with the bass response where if you hit the right frequency it would flatten out. These never did that no matter which album I threw up against them.__For testing I spent an hour and half in the store with my iPod and several albums in FLAC format. I went through various albums, just to name some of the music I sampled on them: Maroon 5 (V), Fireflight (Now), Linkin Park - Living Things, Luke Bryan - My Kind of Party. I had a few playlists I cycled through as I tried on all the headphones in the line. I kept coming back to this pair. I walked out with these and I didnt really need a new pair, but they are just that damn good"
Review 17,"Oh, another year 2016. Another set of phones from manufacturers! I have been hooked onto get the latest phone every year syndrome and love reviewing specifics. Disclaimer, I love Android and have been using from very early days. Samsung Galaxy S7 still is evolutionary. If you have an older phone more than 2 years old, absolutely get this. So do check local specs. I played around with both S7 and S7 Edge for few days and my opinions are based on this. There are tons of reviews going into lot of details, so I am focused on few other aspects like whatÕs out there and how to compare specs. Overall S7 and S7 were very slick. If I have to make a choice between S7 and G5, I will slightly lean towards G5 but both are fantastic!__First Big Changes: microSD is back. And back with a vengeance 200 GB. I love it, and have been using it in my current LG as well. Unfortunately, the battery is non-removable, has not been addressed. The only flagship to feature a removable battery so far this year is the LG G5. I know many of you loyal Samsung fans says BUMMER! I was a diehard fan of Samsung till S4, then I went to LG G2/G3. I was very curious to try out S7 as they are most talked about now. Why did I love it?! Screen is a beauty on S6 Ð Just Gorgeous. Just go to a retail store and feel it!__The Edge feature is still gimmicky. I think it will fold into regular phones at some point. It is certainly fancy and nice to show off, but I would rather buy an Android wear watch like Motorola 360 or Samsung Gear or LG R series.__IF YOU HAVE LAST YEAR model of any phone, PLEASE DONÕT upgrade. Phones are becoming so standard and power packed it makes no sense to upgrade and waste money every year."
Review 18,"The whole time IÕve had the iPhone 6, IÕve been playing a game. I hand the phone to someone, and guess what phone they use based on their immediate reaction. iPhone users are always shocked by the sheer size of the 6; they all think it must be the 6 Plus. Android users, on the other hand, are unfazed. ""This looks just like my phone,"" they all say.__TheyÕre not wrong. The iPhone 6 is 5.44 inches tall and 2.64 inches wide, which slots it right in between last yearÕs Moto X (also a 4.7-inch phone) and the new HTC One. ItÕs almost exactly the same size as SamsungÕs Galaxy S5, just a little thinner and a little lighter. And it shares more in common with the worldÕs many Android phones Ñ and the original, curvy iPhone Ñ than with the sharp, rectangular iPhone 5S.__THE IPHONE 6 IS THE BIG IPHONE FOR EVERYONE__The iPhone 5S was a stark piece of jewelry, a gorgeous object that was slightly cold and unapproachable. The iPhone 6 is far friendlier and far more usable. Mixing form and function this way is hard to do, and Apple gets it largely right.__ItÕs simply and cleanly designed, with a metal back that curves cleanly around the sides. There are few seams and no ugly clutter. The only real flaw is the antenna design: Apple opted to essentially outline the top and bottom of the phoneÕs back with small plastic stripes where wireless radios can transmit signal. It just looks bad, like someone drew on my phone with a marker. HTCÕs simple, striped design on the One M8 is far better, and even AppleÕs glass-strip-on-the-top-and-bottom approach for the 5S looked nicer.__In a weird way, slim and gorgeous as it is, this iPhone begs to have a case on it."
Review 19,"I started out with the Phantom 2 Vision and this is a great product. Very stable with good pictures. My initial aim was to just have an eye in the sky. As I started to get into aerial videos, I began to yearn for something more. After looking at my videos, I started to get more immersed into them and wanting to get better at video recording. This was between Feb - Apr 2015._Then the Phantom 3 happened. First, I did not like the Ôfish eyeÕ lens on the P2 vision as I donÕt have time to do the correction afterwards. Even though there was some stability, I wanted more. I was not too hung up on the range because at 1000ft in daylight, you probably wonÕt see the quadcopter so youÕd have to rely on the video, which cuts in and out around 700ft and sometimes drops out. IÕve decided to sell my Phantom 2 Vision and get the Phantom 3 Advanced._Welcome to the DJI Phantom 3 Advanced with improved range especially video, rectilinear lens and gimbal, added features over its predecessor at a price no one else can beat and itÕs ready to fly right of the box. LetÕs get into it._Physical dimensions of the quadcopter are about the same as the P2 except with the addition of the vision position sensor and gimbal [non-vision plus]. The remote controller is much improved over its predecessor. It is the Inspire 1 remote controller [form, fit and probably 90%+ function]- Contoured rubberized edges for comfortable grip, tablet support capability, video transmitter built in the controller, built-in Lipo battery and camera controls plus the ÒPAFÓ mode switch neatly tucked on the side for unintended operation._Before even using the P3-A, you have to update all of the firmware and calibrate the GPS. Once youÕre done, you are ready to fly. I also liked the fact that all of the aircraft and remote controller settings can be accessed directly from the tablet/mobile device as opposed to its predecessor where it has to be connected to the computer - very smart move DJI._Flying the aircraft itself is pretty fun. It seems very stable in the air. I took videos with probably 10-20 mph wind gusts and it was pretty stable. You could not tell whether the wind was blowing or not. I also like the indoor vision positioning sensors. I plan on capitalizing on this feature, but yet to do so. IÕve been flying outdoors to make sure I get all the practice and not crash this thing. You also have the ability to select preset modes or customize the controls yourself. This is great and make flying become second nature so that I can focus on the camera._The camera, which includes stills and video is awesome. The quality is just superb. It helps a great deal with the camera controls built right into the controller. Gimbal control on the left, video and stills on the left and right plus two additional customizable buttons under the controller. With a few video techniques, you are a pro in no time at all. I also love the built-in director app to quickly edit and compile your videos and watch or send them. ItÕs very intuitive. Using this thing under sunlight can be an extreme killer so IÕve ordered a sunshade. IÕll see how that works out. I also like the fact that you can use either a tablet or phone. IÕd recommend a tablet for the experience, unless you are in a jam and have no other option. YouÕll probably need a lanyard as the controller with the tablet will have some weight and after prolonged use, your muscles will start to twitch. The built in Lipo battery is also another great feature. I pretty much used this thing about 3-4 times within a week and the battery indicator did not go below 75% which is solid. IÕm waiting on the extra battery for the aircraft and do another round of testing. I also like the indicator for the remote controller battery over its predecessor in which I always have extra 4-set of AA batteries._Honestly, I have absolutely no complains using the P3-A. ItÕs a great aircraft to fly and I encourage all of you to constantly review FAA guidelines before flying. It may always seem trivial flying until something goes wrong. I believe DJI has done its best to update the firmware with geofencing as I noticed that I cannot fly in areas I used to fly with the P2 Vision, and thatÕs a very good thing. DonÕt go disabling the GPS [unless you have a license or permission] to make life difficult for the rest of us plus you could lose your bird. Even with the P3-A, IÕve lost signal and I just donÕt know what IÕd do without the peace of mind knowing that the RTH function works for failsafe conditions. Happy flying folks and fly safe!_Update on 11/10/2015_So I've flown this bird now for over 5 months and I must say that I've matured a lot in flying and using the functions or the quadcopter. DJI has also made updates and improvements and it had gotten even better. In no particular order, here goes._1. Feature added for RTH function to come back to remote controller instead of last take-off point._2. Compass calibration and flight altitude resolved_3. All-in-one firmware feature added. This is helpful instead of managing separate files and methods. Update P3-A on SD card and for remote controller, follow on-screen directions on tablet and update. It's that simple. Nice!_4. Ability to downgrade aircraft firmware and hopefully remote as well. It could come in handy._5. I don't like the built-in video editor due to the time limitation and a bunch of stuff. I'vbe seen some upgrades but for a freeware editor, just use GoPro Studio._6. DJI Pilot -> DJI GO. I guess unification is key here._7. Updates to the navigation modes to add 'follow me', 'points-of-interest' including waypoints._There are other updates I believe but I love this thing even more. Great aircraft to fly all over and flying is never as trivial as it seems to be. Practice a lot and be skillful with depth perception as you may think you are clear when in fact you are not. I also limited my distance to 1000ft. I am yet to try and max range and I'll wait until I get a clear line-of-sight to come to that conclusion."
Review 20,I purchased this TV about 2 weeks ago and I can't say enough good things about it. The picture is so clear that it makes you wonder how you lived with 1080p beforehand. But I will warn you it takes some time of working through all of its features before you get this picture. Out of the box it looks good but give yourself an hour or so and you will not believe the difference.__If you have a Xbox One or PS4 you will see a drastic difference as well. I play Destiny on Xbox One and it looks amazing. One thing you will have to do with FPS or action games is switch over to game mode every time. Without this switch you will notice a substantial lag that will make for a not so pleasant gaming experience. Once you switch over to game mode though it looks amazing. The vivid picture does change a little bit but im sure it is to account for the refresh speeds.__I did an awful lot of research before buying a TV in this price range and through all my reading I saw that Hight Dynamic Range (HDR) was extremely important to future proof your investment and this TV has it. The other model I looked very closely at was the new Sony model in the same 55 inch set. Both had amazing picture but the HDR coupled with the slightly better picture in my opinion I chose this model.__I know many people say there isn't much 4K content out right now and that is fairly true. But I have watched a fair number or blu rays the past two weeks and they look stunning. I turned on the UHD upscale and it creates a far better picture than my prior 50 inch LED 1080p TV. One that was particularly amazing was Lucy. The colors are so vibrant its hard to look away.__I hope this helps people looking at this TV and I am happy to answer any questions you might have as it is a big investment for most and the technology can sometimes feel intimidating to some. 
Review 21,"As a consumer who actually bought the ZT60, I think I can put a few things into perspective. Back in '09 I saw a demo of a 50"" Pioneer Kuro plasma (the industry reference for black level quality until now) at a store with the lights switched off. Yes, I was impressed. Blacks looked visibly black. A couple of months ago I went to a Magnolia (Best Buy) store to see if the ZT60 could live up to its hype. The ZT60 was not in a controlled demo room but was placed on a wall directly under a VT60 with a lot of ambient store lighting. Under such lighting conditions, I honestly couldn't see the difference in black level between the VT60 and the ZT60. The main advantage of the ZT60 under bright lighting was somewhat less reflectivity/screen glare. I asked for a demo in the dark demo room but only a VT60 was in the room. I checked out the blacks using night scenes off my own ""Taxi Driver"" and ""American Werewolf in London"" BluRay discs. Blacks were inky black. Since I couldn't do an A-B comparison between a VT60, ZT60, or the Pioneer Kuro TV for black level using the same material the best I can do was base my comparisons of black level on memory. Given the Kuro's already impressive performance, can anything else ""blow it out of the water"", as some posters on CNET put it? I'll just say that the Kuro has finally been laid to rest. But let me say that when a black screen appears on the VT60 it looks extremely dark already.__When looking at a black screen on my ZT60 at home at night with the lights off, it appears that the unit is practically turned off (really). At that level, it's just an exercise in futility to compare it to a Kuro and split hairs. It's plenty good enough for me.__In overall performance it handily beats the very best LED backlit LCDs I've seen, including the current Ultra HD 4K sets (except in resolution) I've seen (since all of them use LED backlighting). At this point, you may be wondering why I would compare a 1080P HDTV to a 2160P (4K) set. Based on the demos of 4K sets that I've seen on 60 to 65-inch screens, the difference (really just resolution) between 1080P and 2160P is only visible when you are standing several inches in front of the screen. Most people would rather view from several feet away in a living room setting. Also, the 4K demo material is video-based. I can't imagine seeing any more detail even from a transfer of a 70mm film print when seated at a normal viewing distance in a living room. In terms of 4K sources, the Blu-Ray format does not support that resolution, leaving Sony to offer a $600 4K media box that only works with their own brand of 4K TVs. There's another alternative in the form of an even more expensive source component. But all this points to a shaky start for yet another format that provides little benefit to consumers. In fact, 4K is just a transitional format for the 2nd tier of the Ultra HD standard, 8K. So why buy 4K at all? Anyway, I digress.__Back to the subject of overall picture quality. With all the statements about black level, you'd think that that was the only important picture parameter. I'll say that one of the first things I noticed about both the VT60 and ZT60 were the great reproduction of different shades of gray (maybe better than the Kuro set which had a tendency to crush dark shades of gray to black). On the ZT60 there seems to be, if anything, also a noticeable advantage in the reproduction of red. Reds are reproduced with a natural purity I've never seen before. I can't comment on the 3D performance of the ZT60 because I don't have a 3D BluRay player but I briefly converted a 2D Blu-Ray to 3D. The motion seemed to appear with the ""soap opera"" (video) effect. That said, 3D performance is not important to me so I consider the feature to be a ""throw in"" anyway.__My only pet peeve about all the professional reviews I've read about the ZT60 is the statement that SD sources look great. While it's true that DVDs appear extremely good on the ZT60 when using an HDMI connection, the aforementioned statement is obviously based on the reproduction of DVDs (which occasionally look like HD sources) and broadcasts. I say this because there is no support for legacy sources that use the S-Video connection. I've seen so many professional reviewers trash this connection by saying that making an S-Video connection was awkward (well, you don't do it often, do you?). Yet, there is no criticism of the old composite video connection's quality. I don't think a professional reviewer would mind putting up with the minor inconvenience, given the composite connection's dot crawl from inherent crosstalk between the luminance (black & white) and chrominance (color) signals. As expensive as the ZT60 is, you'd think that an S-Video input would be included. How much can such an input cost? I make a big deal about this because I have a lot of S-VHS recordings of material I simply can't buy or don't care to buy again in another format and I also have some laserdiscs. The composite input of the ZT60 rolls off the high end of the video signal. Looking at an S-VHS recording of a standard definition Snell & Wilcox resolution test pattern through the composite connection shows a horizontal resolution of well under 300 lines. Yet looking at the same recording through the S-Video input of my old old SDTV shows roughly 410 lines. So what to do? The receiver connected to my ZT60 doesn't have S-Video inputs either so I can't use it for any handshaking between the S-VHS VCR and the ZT60. Fortunately, I have a D-VHS machine that has S-Video inputs and HDMI outputs so I can either play my S-Video recordings through this machine or use its S-Video inputs for my S-VHS VCR (which does a better job playing S-VHS videos) along with the HDMI outputs to the receiver. Result? The 410 lines of resolution appears on the ZT60 and the recordings closely approach DVD quality.__Despite the S-Video omission, I still believe the ZT60 is a 5-star product. Its reduced screen glare/reflectivity, its practically perfect black level, the great reproduction of shadow detail, and extremely accurate colors have seduced me already. In fact, these performance parameters are unrivaled. As I've already mentioned, the first parameter cannot be matched by the current generation of higher resolution Ultra HD TV sets, given their use of LED-backlit technology.__To make the most out of the ZT60, I switch to the THX Cinema mode, load a Spears & Munsil Blu-Ray calibration disc then adjust the black-level, contrast, sharpness according to the disc's test patterns and set the color temperature to the normal setting. I didn't find the recommended picture adjustments of CNET reviewer, David Katzmaier, helpful. In fact, the settings seem to appear way off when looking at the results when using my OPPO BDP-83 Blu-Ray player as a source.__In a nutshell, I'd list the Pros vs. Cons as follows:__Pros:_Unrivaled picture quality_Extremely accurate colors/color temperature in the THX mode/EBU modes right out of the box_Beats The Pioneer Kuros black level and gray scale reproduction_Low screen glare/reflectivity compared to all other plasmas to date__Cons:_Expensive_No S-video input to make the most of S-VHS sources; composite video input rolls off high-end and makes SD sources appear duller than they are_Comment |_Looking for voting buttons? Sorry, we don't let customers vote on their own reviews.__2/28/2014 Update Regarding 3D viewing: Initially, I commented on a ""soap opera"" effect when switching to the 3D viewing mode. Upon closer examination, I realized that the motion-smoothing circuitry was turned on by default in this mode. Once I went through the ""Picture"" menu options to defeat the motion smoothing, the ""soap opera"" effect disappeared. Be that as it may, unless you have genuine 3D source material (mine is simulated from a non-3D Blu-Ray player), you may quickly grow tired of the 3D viewing mode. After about 30 minutes or less of viewing in 3D mode, my eyes felt a bit fatigued. So I just watched in 2D mode.__If I were to sum up the appearance of the 3D mode, the results are not unlike what you would see when looking through old ""Viewmaster"" 3D slides (remember those?). Rather than seemingly palpable images, objects appear to be 2D cutouts layered at varying depths. The appearance isn't unpleasant but it's not realistic either. I'm not faulting the ZT60 for this because this is a characteristic I've noticed with all the 3D sets I've watched."
Review 22,"I've owned this product for about a month now and purchased it because I was frustrated with seatmates on airplanes looking at my notebook screen for the whole flight, trying to figure out what I was doing. This screen works wonders in deterring others from taking glances at my private information. In fact, most people think I'm crazy, typing away on a computer with a blank screen, or so they think.There are some disadvantages with this screen though. Your seatmate directly next to you will be able to see through the filter to your screen partially, because they are within the viewing angle of the screen with the filter on. But move over any farther and the screen is not visible, nor is it visible across the aisle (if sitting in an aisle seat). About the only other place that it is visible is if someone is standing directly above you, one row back. Turning down the brightness of your screen also helps immensely in blocking people from viewing your screen through the filter at any angle.(Please note, having this filter installed screens out about half of the light coming out of the screen. If you have poor eyesight with dim lighting and have trouble with computer screens, this product may not be for you.)Additionally, the clear plastic tabs included with the filter adheres to the plastic border around the notebook LCD screen to keep the filter in place. It works, but blocks about a 1/8"" of the screen at 6 points, especially noticeable around the bottom of the screen where the start bar is located.You'll also notice a large ""3M PF14.1W"" printed in the top right hand corner of the filter. It's used to help in determining whether the filter is facing the right direction, but it's quite distracting at times. The height of the lettering is equivalent in size to the window bar at the top of any program.This filter is also very dust, lint, debris, and smudge attracting. You'll find yourself wiping the filter often.Overall, this filter does its job. Great for those who need to comply with HIPPA or other privacy regulations. But as an individual consumer, I wonder if the high price is justified for the benefits it provides."
Review 23,"I just purchased the Hero 3+ Black Edition one month ago. When the Hero 4 came out I had to try it and I ended up returning my Hero 3+. Why did I get the Hero 4 Silver over the Hero 4 Black and the Hero 3+ Black?Three Reasons:1. The Hero 4 Black is $499 and does not come with an LCD (because of heat issues from 4k they could not put on an LCD).So really if you bought an LCD BacPac for the Black edition, it would cost you a total of $579 compared to the $399 of the Silver. This is a $180 difference!2. The two models BOTH have improved sharpness compared to the Hero3+ Black.This video compares the sharpness of the Hero3+ Black, to the Hero4 Silver, and the Hero4 Black:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Y2iTSNy8g&list=UUTs-d2DgyuJVRICivxe2KtgWatch this video to compare the Hero4 Black to the Hero3+ Black:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BacBT268-pQ&list=UUTs-d2DgyuJVRICivxe2KtgThen watch this video to compare the Hero4 Black to the Hero4 Silver:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNazYkq4omY&list=UUTs-d2DgyuJVRICivxe2KtgAs you can see the sharpness between the Hero 4 Black and the Silver is the SAME. They both have the same upgraded sensor/lens and it's definitely improved over the 3+ Black. Yes, the 4 Black can do 4k at 30 FPS, 2.7k48, and 1080p120 while the 4 Silver can only do 2.7k at 30 FPS, 1080p60 (it can do 4k 15 FPS but that is not really usable for most purposes). But to be honest, that is the only improvement and it is a $180 difference! At this moment I cannot justify 4k for that much of an additional increase. I am happy with what the 4 Silver offers AND I get an LCD which is extremely convenient.3. Compare the battery life of the Hero 4 Black vs the Hero 4 Silver here:http://gopro.com/support/articles/hero4-camera-battery-lifeAt 2.7k 30 FPS, the Black only lasts 1 hour and 10 minutes while the Silver lasts 1 hour and 50 minutes!! This is the SAME resolution. Why? Because the Black has a more powerful processor to handle the 4k, and this causes it to eat up more battery regardless of the frame rate.Given these three reasons, I do not believe the Hero 4 Black is worth the cost. But the Hero 4 Silver is definitely a bargain and worthy of an upgrade from the 3+ Black edition. Don't forget in addition to the cost, the Hero 4 Silver has identical specs as the Hero 4 Black (except for 4k 30 FPS). This means you will also get (compared to the 3+ Black):- Upgraded sensor with better ability to resolve detail- 2x the WiFi Speed (less lag and faster transfer speeds)- 2x the Dynamic Range for Audio Quality - watch this video comparing! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXVPyTCr-E&list=UUTs-d2DgyuJVRICivxe2Ktg- Bluetooth Capability- Night Photo Mode (and ability to control shutter speed)- Night Time Lapse Mode (and ability to control shutter speed)- Protune for Photos- Auto white balance in Protune (enables higher bitrate while allowing for zero editing in post)- LCD TouchScreen (Silver only)All of these are the same upgrades on the Hero 4, so really you're trading $180 and the LCD screen on the Silver for 4k 30 FPS and decreased battery life on the Black edition. Each person may have their own opinion but I think this is a big problem for most users because the cost does not justify the upgrade.I haven't had too much of a chance to test it out, but quick photos and videos showed it truly is sharper than the Hero 3+ Black edition. And given the video links I posted above, it is the same sharpness as the Hero 4 Black (unless you shoot in 4k of course). The touch screen is a GREAT addition and very responsive. It works like I would want it to so I am happy with that.Battery Life with LCDI also recently tested out the battery life with the LCD screen always on. The Hero 4 Silver comes with an auto-off of 1 minute and can be set at either 1 minute, 2 minutes, 3 minutes, or always on. The LCD brightness can also be set at high, medium, and low. My first test was with the LCD always on, brightness set to high, recording 2.7k 30 FPS. I was able to get 1 hour and 40 minutes out of the battery! That is pretty amazing as I did not expect that with the high brightness setting. I then did a test with the LCD off with the same frame rate and got 1 hour and 45 minutes (I did this 3 times with the same result).This means the LCD draws very little power (which is really really great)! For scuba diving, you will need the screen always on as you cannot activate it again once it turns off under water (unless you stop recording and record again but that can be annoying) and knowing it doesn't affect the battery significantly is a great plus. I also tested the Hero 3+ Black in 2.7k 30 and got 1 hour and 38 minutes so the battery life between the two cameras really is the same; even though the Hero4 is 20 mAH less it seems to give more battery life (1180 mAH in the Hero 3+ while 1160 in the Hero 4).Battery BacPacFor those curious I also tested the new Battery BacPac (claims 15% increased battery life) and compared it to the older Hero 3+ Battery BacPac. I used the Hero 4 Silver and recorded at 2.7k 30 FPS with LCD off. I got 2 hours and 57 minutes with new Battery BacPac compared with 2 hours and 27 minutes with the older Battery BacPac! So improvement of about 30 minutes is not bad at all! This is more than 15% (it was 35% with my test)! GoPro claims the Hero 4 Silver should get 3 hours with the Battery BacPac with 2.7k 30 FPS so I definitely would consider that result accurate.ConclusionOverall a great improvement and the recent firmware update released on the 14th of October has fixed all the minor bugs that were out there. I would highly recommend getting this especially if you are upgrading from an older model like the Hero 2 and Hero 3. If you have the money it is worth the upgrade from the Hero 3+ especially for the LCD, the improved sharpness, night time lapse modes, and audio improvements. I think the double wifi speed and bluetooth connectivity are bonuses but I wouldn't upgrade just for those reasons alone but if you combine all the other benefits it's definitely worth the upgrade!"
Review 24,"I purchased this phone to replace my LG Optimus 3 and so far am fairly happy with it. My previous phone lasted 2.5 years and I purchased this one specifically because it was an LG phone which appeared to be an updated, improved version of my previous model. The biggest thing to know about this phone is that it is very large to be considered a phone. You can operate it with one hand, but it's far more comfortable with two. However, since I rarely make phone calls and mostly use this for messaging, browsing, maps, and games when away from home, this was not a drawback for me.Like most smartphones offered by Virgin Mobile, it comes loaded with a ton of programs I had no desire for. However, it offered more memory and a better camera than anything else they had available in the under $200 price range. And a good portion of the unwanted programs were quite easily uninstalled or disabled. The version of Android on this phone is fast and was worth the slightly higher price versus the model I had previously. I find that my favorite feature thus far is the stylus, which was not something I thought I wanted. But it's super easy to use and works so much better than I expected from using them with other touch pad systems (think signature pads at retail stores).The battery life is pretty good - the day I received it, I used it pretty heavily for about 6 hours while migrating my info from my old phone, setting this one up on the network, and otherwise installing apps and checking out features and barely drained a quarter of the battery. Most days, I unplug it in the morning and find I have 30-40% still left when I go to plug it in for the night, and it charges to full in just under an hour.This phone also has a snap off back. Which is really a double edged sword. It's great because it means you can replace your own battery, your micro SD card for expanding memory is protected inside the case instead of in a slot on the side where it is prone to damage, and at least with my old phone which had the same snap off back (exactly the same thing), dropping the phone generally results in the back snapping off, which absorbs most of the impact, leaving your phone undamaged, other than the battery lying on the floor. But at the same time, I replaced my old phone because those snaps eventually gave way. One by one they snapped off until I was holding it on with one little tab and electrical tape. So yeah, I highly recommend buying a case. I never got one for my old phone, but it still lasted 2.5 years with only cosmetic damage. I definitely purchased one for this one at the same time I purchased the phone.Other features I liked:- Reader-mode: Changes lighting/color specifically to make reading e-books or extended text easier on your eyes- Camera - it's nice. Much nicer than the one from my LG Optimus 3, or any other phone available on Virgin that I looked at while shopping.- Power button/camera shutter button/volume is on the back. I used to kill my battery bumping buttons in my pocket.- Twice as much memory as my previous Virgin Mobile phone- Some of the preloaded stuff was just what I would have wanted anyway - Google Suite of Apps (music, drive, photos, messaging, hangouts, etc), Amazon Kindle. Even came preloaded with LG Backup which made porting the files and contacts from my old phone super easy.Not so great things:- Power port and headphone jack both on the bottom - a minor annoyance since I often listen to music in the evening and charge while I listen.- So much bloatware. But I was prepared. I figure it's the price I pay for not shelling out $75-100/mo. to Sprint or Verizon on a contract. Some of what I call bloatware will probably be some things users would want though. For example, Instagram, Facebook, Amazon Music, and Youtube all came already installed. There were only a few that wouldn't go away.- Large - The large screen is great for reading e-books and watching videos, but this will not fit in most of my pockets. Unless you wear cargo pants or medical scrub pants, you're probably gonna have to get a belt clip or a purse to carry this guy around."
Review 25,"I was very skeptical with this product, not only was I wrong but I have been so amazed with the ease , convenience and functionality this hue product that I cannot hesitate in recommending to purchase this item . I myself have recommended a few friends and I have shown the functionality off this product. plenty of apps for this product, to work with OS X and of course IOS 9. I found the best apps are free to work with your OS X which does not limit you to use your IOS only. Initial cost is worth it, it really makes a difference to control your environment as you please, I am a quadriplegic and only have functionality of my Apple products and discuss giving me freedom that I cannot explain, just enjoy...hope you will consider and enjoy this product."
Review 26,"This is a really great start for someone motivated to learn about electronics. The kit is quite complete, starting with flashing an LED light, and touching topics like controlling lights and motors. There are well documented opportunities to learn about components, electronic theory, and C programming. You CAN buy the individual parts and save a few bucks, but unless you work next to radio shack, this is the way to go.A major plus is the guide that comes with the kit. There are 12 projects, each with diagrams of the parts, how to connect them, and example programs to make them work. There are even instructions on what to do if it doesn't work right, and references if you want to learn more about particular topics. I should think that a well motivated 8 year old could use this kit with supervision. No soldering is involved except for one motor, and one could use alligator clips from radio shack to avoid that. An adult could handle this kit without previous knowledge of electronics or programming.There are a few things that would enhance this kit. The main thing would be to buy a plastic organizer box. As you go through the projects, parts and wires tend to get loose and it can be frustrating to find parts after a while. Also, you might consider buying a 9 volt battery or a power adapter. You don't really need it, but it demonstrates that the projects work without being connected to a computer, a key concept because this kit is essentially a computer in itself. Quick note: the servo project does not work well on a 9 volt battery, too much power drain. Works fine when it's on the USB cable.The rest of this review is pretty trivial, read at your own risk.The kit comes in a nice closeable box. If you open it carefully, it will keep the parts safe and sound. But, a plastic organizer would be even better. The kit comes with a ton of wire jumpers and as you go through the projects, the pile of wires and parts gets a bit annoying.You will need to download the software. It is PC, Mac and Linux compatible. I use a PC. The manual gives you the site to go to. You will need to register to get the download, but you don't need to enter credit cards or personal information.The main parts are the Arduino board and a breadboard to hook up the components. The kit includes a plastic tray to keep things neat. The Arduino board simply snaps in, and the breadboard has an adhesive backing. Unfortunately, I found the clips that hold the Arduino board are a bit fragile. I broke a clip and ended up using foam sticky tape to hold it in. Not a big deal.As to the projects, I made standard mistakes. I put parts in backwards, stuff like that. The board seems tolerant of this. I did not destroy any parts, I just went back through the steps and found my mistakes. The manual is really good on this part, the diagrams are excellent. As you insert parts in the breadboard, you might think the connections are bit loose, particularly the resistors. But, I just went with it and didn't have any connection issues.For me, the best project was the servo motor. Turning on lights are one thing, but to make a motor turn precisely is pretty cool. Perhaps a bit too cool. After I got it running, my cat got a bit too interested in the moving thing. On that subject, there is one error I have found in the manual so far. The wire colors on the servo do not match the diagrams. Here is the fix: Negative, black goes to servo brown. 5 volts goes to servo red, and the signal from digital pin 9 goes to servo yellow.Maybe the best thing about this kit is what happens after you finish the projects. The user might be most interested in the programming, the wiring, the components or electronic theory. That spark of interest could easily lead a young person to a great career choice.And, maybe your kid will just put this on a shelf, but if it sparks that interest, then it is well worth the cost. Whatever the case, the servo project makes a great cat toy.If it sparks that interest, there are many add-ons that are compatible, inexpensive, and well documented. One might move on to an LCD display, a range module (tells you distance, good for robotics) and tons of shields, or add-on boards that stack on top to give you ways to do things via networks, or anything else one might want.In essence, if you or your kids are getting a little bored with legos and erector sets, this would not be a bad thing to try out."
Review 27,"Alright just a brief summary first and I'll get to the pros and cons. I've used this laptop a few days, and I've got to say, I've probably never liked a laptop more than ever. It's light, fast with regards to opening programs and boot time, its got a nice big ssd, room for upgrades like a 2.5in hard drive and 1 SO-DIMM 2133mhz 8gb stick of ram to make this a 16gb ram laptop, but I felt the keyboard was a bit wierd because of the key texture, the size of the numpad numbers (i use a pin for my windows log in and just used to the regular sized keys) and the cooling could be better gaming wise. The reason the cooling configuration could be better because when you're gaming the gpu and cpu are throttled. This is fixed with either a homemade standoff with the laptop or a laptop fan stand. And other than that, the touchpad, bluetooth, wifi and everything else was pretty good.So here it is, the Pros:Its light, you can have it on your lap and it wont heat up (major bonus points because I would love to have a non heavy laptop that you can game on the desk, but also use on your lap for less intensive stuff, its upgrade-able and the touchpad, it feels good and pressure you need to click is just right. Oh and the back panel is easy to remove, and its held on by clips after the screws so be gentle when removing the back panel.The Cons:Throttling due to low rise of the laptop through its rubber studs, the screen is not an IPS or higher quality, the ram is soldered, and the solid state drive has a capacity of only 476gb instead of being near 512..... and the back panel has so many screws....Also soon i'll be posting some framerate tests for some modern games and some classic favorites (skyrim, fallout 3, etc) on my channel, aswell as a review: Just look for Wyrless FreequincyEdit: Its confirmed that this laptop does indeed have ddr4 ram."
Review 28,"MPRESSION BASED ON EXPERIENCE:This is my second pair of Motorola 2-Way radios. I have tried other bands like Midland and been very disappointed, but Motorola has never let me down. I needed two extra radios for a fishing trip to Colorado so that my father, my brother, my son and I could stay in touch. I was amazed at how good these radios did in the mountains. At one point I was over three miles away from my father on the other side of a mountain and we could still talk clearly. Now I know 3 miles in not as far as the 23 miles range that is claimed these radios can reach, but if you know anything about how these radios transmit, then you know that for it to transmit clearly through 3 miles of solid mountain is close to a miracle. I have a pair of Midland G-300 Two Way Radios that claim a 10 mild range that cannot even reach 1/2 a mile through forest on straight level ground. I was also impressed with the battery life. Even after a long day of heavy use these units had plenty of power left. One was left on over night after being used all day and it still had power the next day.Since I want this review to be helpful to people people wanting to buy these, I want to make something clear. The range claim that any 2-way radio manufacturer makes, is base on optimum conditions with no structural or atmospheric interference. In real life you can never expect to get those kinds of ranges out of any unit. Due to the curvature of the earth I would not expect that any radio could reach farther then 10 miles under normal conditions unless each radio is located in an elevated position with a valley in between, such as on either side of the Grand Canyon. So when you buy a 2-way radio, don't pay much attention to the range claims that are made. Just make sure that they will do what you need them to and don't expect a miracle that deifies the laws of physics.PROS:Motorola quality, great range and battery life.CONS:None that I can find.THE BOTTOM LINE:If you are looking for a good pair of 2-way radios for hiking, camping, fishing or similar, look no farther. If you are looking for 2-way radios for some sort of specialized professional use or something else these may or may not be what you are looking for."
Review 29,"I am considering this to be a layman's review. I know this is long but I feel there are several things that are, quite frankly, scary about getting into the world of ""hi-fi"" headphones. I have never owned a pair of headphones that cost more than 20 bucks and have been quite content for my 21 years of life to do so. Someone who looks for the audiophile in their headphones won't get much from me because honestly I don't know enough. This is also not a gaming review, as I've heard many people look at these for playing Counter Strike or the like. More on that later but I'm making this review from a music listening standpoint. This review is for the person who thinks a 15 dollar pair of generic Sony's sounds just fine.As I start writing this review, I've had these headphones on for about an hour. These were brand new out of the box. The very first thing I noticed when I actually opened the box and had them in my hands was ""wow, besides the size and the fact that I just paid 90 bucks for something to wear on my head, these are impressively unimpressive."" I read many, many review that held this on a pedestal and I was half expecting trumpets when I opened the box. It took a week and a half from the time I ordered them to when I got them today since I choose super saver shipping. I knew it would take a while to get here but the biggest problem was that during that time, I looked at every review I could find. I looked around for about 3 hours before I bought these and then bought them because they seemed pretty good and I'm not the type to stress over a purchase like this.While I was waiting, I got honestly afraid that I had made a bad choice. It seemed like the good things could be great but if you hadn't already tried these out in person, if you didn't like something, they were no better than a paper weight. The lack of bass, will it move around or fall off, is my head several inches too small to be in the same room as these, do I need an amp, do these leak sound like water in a pasta strainer, and PURPLE. I even thought about canceling the order and just taking a trip to Wal-Mart. I'm glad I didn't. Here's why:THE BAD (or so I've heard)-The lack of bass. I think this was the most common issue I heard on any site. I've heard that there is no bass at all and I've heard that it is there but it is controlled. I am with the latter camp. The very first thing I did when I had them on was put on some dance music. I was worried that half the notes would get lost somewhere between my iPod and speakers. And then... there they were. My head was in no way being knocked around from the bass thump, but I could clearly hear the notes. That was the first big difference I noticed between these headphones and the apple ones that came with my last iPod. My iPod headphone had one bass note then another bass note and over and over without much change. With the 700's I can clearly hear each bass note for what it is and each note is given its turn to be in the spotlight short though it may be. If you want headphones that may fracture your skull, go elsewhere. These headphones play each bass note like a note, not a jackhammer. I've heard that using the bass booster in the EQ will add bass. Yep, it does. It also makes the music terrible. This could be because I just got them and they haven't been broken in yet, but it gave the song a really muddy sound. The bass seemed to just rattle and not actually make music while the anything higher than a bass drum retreated. The bass is fine as it is.-The Size. These are big. This is the second biggest issue I saw. If you are still growing, these probably wont be a great fit. I can bop my head around a good bit without trouble and walking isn't a big deal. They do shift a bit and they do feel like they could slip off. They shift because they aren't clamped down on my head like a vice which makes them comfortable. The feeling that they could slip off is more mental. My ears fit quite nicely in the hole in the middle of the pads and so long as I don't whip my head from one side to the other, they stay on fine. They feel lighter than it seems they should for their size which doesn't help but so long as you don't go running with them, they should be fine. Their size also makes them not portable without some effort. They have a long cord and they don't fold up. If you are just going to use these at a desk, not a problem, but you will have to work around the headphones a bit to make them you primary pair for going from place to place. Not impossible but a challenge.-The amp. ""I've heard some headphones need an amp to sound good. Do I need to buy one for these?"" No. These work just fine on their own. If you have an iPod, there's already one in there. It probably wouldn't hurt to buy an amp specifically to use with your headphones but mine sound fine out of my iPod.-Sound leakage. These were not designed to block out noise of any sort. They are an open design and NOT noise canceling. I had a normal conversation with these on while a song was playing and I could hear both perfectly well. If you have the volume at a reasonable level, you can hear everything that goes on around you. I can hear the click of each key as I type this and I'm just slightly below half volume on my iPod. This works both ways. If you have this up in a quiet environment, other people can hear what you are listening too. If you keep it at a moderate level and there is some background noise, you could listen to these in a library.PURPLE! Yes, they have purple mesh. Yes, you will look like you have part of a space helmet on your head. The purple really doesn't look all that bad. I think that it looks nice and classy and fits. It looks overwhelming in the pictures but unless someone has a deep hatred of purple, you might actually have people telling you they like it. Worse comes to worse, buy a sharpie of any color your little heart desires and go wild. That being said, prepare to have all respect for your fashion sense lost in the eyes of anyone who sees these on your head and to possibly be called some not so nice things. You will look like a goofball wearing these. As I said earlier, they are huge. They nearly double the size of my head. The cups are thick and the wings will mess up your hair. While the purple isn't really noticeable, everything else is. I don't really care because of all the good things I'm going to mention shortly make up for looking like a spaceman.THE GOODHere's why you will want to buy these. Now.-The Sound. Brilliant. The bass is clear and each note is present. The midrange and vocals ring and sound natural and the way they are meant to. The highs aren't a struggle for these headphones to reach. The entire range is clearly there and yet no one section is more important than any other. It sounds like you are in each instrument. In an orchestra, instead of the entire group being one giant collaboration of musicians, you can hear each section individually. On a high quality recording, you can almost hear every instrument being played. A lot of reviews say that you can hear subtle parts of song that you've never heard before in songs you memorized a hundred listens ago. This is true. Since the entire range is present you hear parts of the song that on other, lower quality headphones are covered up by either vocals or another section of the range. Each sound gets its own place instead of just blurring everything together. On the other side, it still retains the flow of the over all piece. Each part fits into a constantly building puzzle.-Construction. Despite looking strange, they are built very solidly. Nothing feels flimsy or like it would break quickly from normal use. I haven't had these very long so I can't say how long they will last but I'm not worried they are going to snap in two if I set them down too hard. The cord is very nice and doesn't go anywhere near your face like some others do. It also doesn't feel like its going to pull out of the cup like some cheap earbuds do. The wire only goes into the left side and uses the spring on top to power the right cup.Comfort. The highest quality thing about these. I'm not used to things this big being on my head for long periods so I'm having to do a bit of fidgeting with them to get then right but I've felt no pain since I first put them on. The cup and padding design angle the speaker so the face is pointed more towards your ear with an empty space for your ear to rest comfortably. The wings on top are barely noticeably unless you think about them but they keep the pads off the top of your ears. The pads themselves are very soft and don't hold heat. These are the least noticeable headphone I have ever worn so long as I don't think about them and just listen to the music which is the point .Soundstage. Another biggie that people talk about. You can tell different noises a part. This is part of why the sound is so good. I'm not a big gamer so I can't mention anything there but on a capella track that have used multiple microphones for recording, I can hear where each person is standing. One of its best features without a doubt.I highly recommend this for someone who wants to buy a set of quality headphones but doesn't have much interest in learning all the fancy jargon that comes with the audiophile community. There is a noticeable difference between some cheap earbuds and these fantastic pillows with speakers. If you can try a pair, do. They wont play a brand new song but what you do hear is improved."
Review 30,"I bought this as a pet tracker even though they don't necessarily recommend it for that use. I have a cat that tends to wander off but never very far. I figured with a 100 foot radius + me walking around enough I'd be able to track her down.I tested it like crazy with all her usual hiding spots to make sure it'd work for me and that I wouldn't have to return it and was very impressed that it surpassed the 100 foot range by quite a bit. I didn't actually measure, but I counted my steps. 95 steps away and it still kept a connection. Excellent!Before I put it on her collar, several times a day I'd activate it with her nearby so it plays its tune, and I'd give her a treat. Hoping she'd learn to hear the tune and come home for a treat. Well that part worked. When she's in range, I click ""find"" to play the tune and she runs home for her treat. Or perhaps she's running home because she's freaked out about this music that's chasing her. Either way, success!The only downfall is that sometimes she's 10 feet away and it will say ""out of range"". If I stand there long enough it does usually connect, but it's frustrating to wait for it to catch up. Also, the dotted circle that's supposed to tell you if you're getting hot or cold isn't always very accurate. So I find myself walking back and forth quite a bit feeling like I'm being punk'd by my own cat.All in all, it's surpassed my expectations. I've been able to find her every time. Sometimes it takes a lot longer since it has trouble connecting at times. I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could, but since I can't, I'll give it 5 since I'm using it for something it's not even advertised to do, and it's still doing it quite well."
Review 31,"When I saw the reviews and features, I preordered two of them. They got delivered the same day, and boy the box was clean and properly packaged.After drooling over the boxes, I plugged one in, without remembering to turn on Steam; it already worked as a mouse without any setup at all. I turned on Steam, and the software updated.Skip to present day, I use this thing all over. Let me tell you some crazy things you can do with this controller!* Program any button to any xbox 360, keyboard, or mouse functions (including multiple, e.g. Alt+Tab)* Program independent (horizontal / vertical) (sensitivity / axis inversion)* Select commonly used community created layouts for Steam Games (and tweak them yourself!)* Configure your controller for non-Steam games* Grab buttons (Ring Finger / Pinky Finger)* 2 Touchpads (can be mouse, joystick, anything in between, as well as DPads, WASD / other key configurations, screen area selection (e.g. minimap), hotkeys (up to a 4x4 grid, I believe), /and more/!* Standard xbox-feeling layout (left / right movement, joystick below, grips, and gyro may take some learning, and ABXY buttons are considered small by many)* Haptics! What does that mean? It means you get rumbles of vibration feedback based on activity, independent of trackpad and joystick programming. E.G. Left trackpad could have no haptics, joystick (left) strong haptics, right trackpad low haptics, and gyro medium haptics! Wow!* Gyro capabilities: That's right, you can select yaw or roll and start using this baby as a steering wheel. Or, to control movement when a certain button is held. Want both? Do both. They'll be independant controls, and easily programmed. Want to make that gyro function control a mouse? Be my guest.* Mode Shifting: This one's going to be a mouthful to explain. Basically, you can make the A key change the B key to another key. Or, the right trigger soft pull change your mouse sensitivity to low while changing your scope button to your fire button, while enabling gyro and turning the mouse trackpad into a dpad on full pull, with your melee button becoming a quick unscope button... Or however you'd like.Let's do another example: You want your left trackpad to act as a trackball mouse with a deadzone, and the horizontal to be more sensitive because you have two monitors side by side acting as one, giving you a super wide resolution. Then, you're playing a game with 16 different hotkeys that you need to program, without reaching over to another device or your keyboard to try and remember what they are... And you want to program icons for them as well. You can make any button on the controller switch the mode of the trackpad to the hotkey selection. This goes for either trackpad, meaning it's really on you to come up with whatever you're comfortable with using. Any layout, this is the most capable controller.The possibilities are endless, and all you need is to program it once in Big Picture; no, you don't have to use big picture to play your games, only to program the controller. It works in that game the same way after you program it, and you can save different layouts and switch at the push of a few buttons whenever you'd like.The only downside to this controller that I can find is the learning curve; otherwise every individual is entitled to their opinion of how good this controller is. If you're looking to replace that keyboard and mouse, become a couch gamer, up your gaming capabilities, play around with a $50 toy, or just show off to your friends, this controller is the bomb dot com.To this day, I've probably put a solid 50 hours of use into this, and it's at 100% battery life... with two AA batteries. That's right, two AA batteries, 50 hours use, and 100% battery life.Not sold? Let me tell you another thing about how frequently they're updated.You might know that these just came out, less than two months ago. Well, the Gyro function, the Hotkey Trackpad function, and the Area Selection function... Those are all new in the last update from a few days ago. New, as in, they completely added a Gyro function that didn't exist previously, just in the software alone.This thing is perfect in every single way, as long as you don't mind struggling to learn a new controller for a bit. I'd say it's well worth every cent.I was NOT paid to write this review, nor given anything at any discount nor for free. I preordered these with my own money, and don't regret a second of it."
Review 32,"I have been using Logitech's MX Revolution for about 5 or 6 years now, unable to switch to the successors of that particular mouse because of suggested downgrades. When the MX Master was announced and Revolution fans suggested that it could be the worthy, true successor to the MX Revolution, I pre-ordered it. Well, the mouse arrived yesterday and though I've only been using it, here are my initial reactions.First, I do think that this is a worthy successor to the Revolution, though some things have changed. There aren't any major drawbacks in just ~24 hours of use (mostly doing web development, general browsing, on both a PC and Mac). I'm going to update this review as I use the mouse more, but here are my first reactions.- The mouse is slightly larger than the Revolution, about the same width but slightly taller. This is fine and it's been comfortable to use coming from the MX. The contoured edges are a nice touch and don't give me a 'sweaty hand' like other contoured mice have in the past.- The ratchet scroll / free spin scroll wheel is the single most sought after feature of this mouse, and it has a toggle button where the Revo's (useless) search button used to be. I will almost never use the ratchet click because I've gotten so used to the free spinning wheel and can't find any use for a slower scroll now that I've been using free spin for half a decade. This can also be controlled via software, so you can set it to free spin as all times and re-assign that button if you'd like. The horizontal scrolling on the scroll wheel (tilting it left/right) has been removed from the Revo. It's been replaces with another function (see 2 paragraphs down).- Which brings me to the software called ""Logitech Options"" which is much improved. It's obvious that Logitech invested in this area over the years, as their old Logitech Control Center software for the Revolution was really lousy, even in 2009 it felt dated and clunky. The new application is light, only took a few seconds to download, and it highlights the areas of the mouse that you can tweak. Everything was clear and made sense to me, where as the Revo's software felt like features were hidden in bizarre menus or given annoying trademarked names so you really didn't know what they did or meant without trying them out.- Back to the hardware, the jog dial has been replaced with a small north/south wheel on the left side of the mouse that has the right amount of tension. Out of the box, this is used to horizontal scroll, which I find only passingly useful. There just aren't that many applications (for me) where I regularly use horizontal scroll intentionally. The software allows you to re-assign this to cycle through your tabs or applications (similar to ctrl + tab for Chrome, or alt + tab for windows). The tab scrolling is nice and it works but it's not as immediate as the jog dial if you went through the work to re-assign that. But so far, tab scrolling works in Chrome, SublimeText, Dreamweaver CC (2014), and Photoshop CC (2014), which is much more support than the old jog dial implementation had. I haven't tried a tabbed piece of software that doesn't work yet. Even Lync client for Windows (with vertical tabs for conversations) works, so I'd imagine this is fairly universal support.- One drawback is the two tiny buttons next to the jog wheel which replaced the back/forward buttons on the old Revo. These buttons are difficult to press and feel spongy because they have this diminutive design that doesn't feel great. It's tough to differentiate between them at first. Out of the box, these control back/forward in the browser and you can't map them to too many different commands (like switching tabs for instance).- A strange new feature which I'm still undecided on is this gesture button. So, I heard this described and I wasn't sure how it would work. On the base of the mouse, say where your thumb would rest, there is a button that you can press (but it's flush with the design of the mouse) that allows you to quickly move your mouse in a particular motion to do some command. Out of the box in Windows I have it set to snap my windows left/right, and on the Mac I have it switch desktops. This works, but it's... not intuitive and honestly feels like it takes more work to feel for this button and then quickly move the mouse. One thing Logitech did well is that your mouse cursor ""locks"" in place while this button is held down, so it makes it more intuitive in knowing whether you're doing some gesture command. It's a nice attempt to build gestures into the mouse but it doesn't quite work like how the marketing materials want you to believe. The good thing? This can be remapped to do dozens of different commands.- The mouse can be assigned to control up to 3 devices, which is great. I use a PC at work, I have a Mac Mini for development at home, and then a MacBook Air for browsing/light use and it's nice to have this mouse work on all 3 devices with just the click of a button (a device selector is flush with the unit on the underside).- Syncing via bluetooth on OS X Yosemite was flawless. Connecting to the wireless dongle (the tiny one that Logitech has used for most of their devices) was equally intuitive.- The device charges via a 3 foot USB cable which can also send a connection over. Seems like it works, not much to report here.- Other things like precision of the pointer, etc., I'm not the best to report on... Seems fine? After years of use the MX Revolution would skip frames on me on my PC, but I think that's more related to a not-so-great work computer, rather than the mouse... but so far, so good on the MX Master. I can't comment on battery life yet, I've been using the mouse for less than 24 hours.Conclusion:So far, I would give this mouse 5 stars. That doesn't mean that it's perfect, for instance the gestures could be improved and I would like it if the software let you re-assign every button to do anything... As it is, some buttons can't be re-assigned to do *everything* (like switching tabs with the back/forward buttons). But, thus far, it is certainly a worthy successor to the MX Revolution and one that I have easily transitioned to.As I continue using the mouse, I'll continue to update this.** Update 48 Hours Later **So, with 48 hours of fairly heavy use, the first noteworthy adjustment I made was turning *OFF* the ""Smooth Scrolling"" in the Logitech Options application. I was noticing that very, very subtle movements of the wheel caused a page to scroll up or down, which was only mildly annoying on a typical scrolling website, but made using any sort of mapping site (Google Maps, etc) or applications where the wheel performs some command (photoshop) frustrating. In fact, I noticed that if I just moved the mouse rapidly, the page would slowly scroll down because the mouse wheel was so sensitive with smooth scroll turned on. I turned this off and now I am happy to report consistent, predictable scrolling and no noticeable change to how it feels when I do scroll intentionally on a page.** Update 10 business days later **Battery life is still kicking on 2 Bars after the first full charge. I also turn it off at night when I go home (and on weekends), but use the mouse heavily from 9am to 5pm. Not sure how long the final 2 bars will last, but so far, seems like strong performance.** Update 6+ months later **I have two of these mice now, one for home and one for work, and I've noticed mousewheel drifting when the mouse is set to the free spin option. It's more noticeable on OS X than on Windows probably because OS X is more sensitive to track movements. Basically, on a free spin, the wheel will rebalance itself by tilting back a fraction of a spin... This can cause a page to drift back up or down in a specific direction. It's hard to explain so I've added a video of it. Looking this problem up online, Logitech has suggested turning off the freespin if you're experiencing this, but that isn't a solution to me. Dropping a star because of this annoying problem.(Also, sorry Amazon's video compression is terrible so you can't see the details of this, but towards the end of the video the mouse wheel drifts backwards from the direction I was spinning)"
Review 33,"I most recently decided it was time to replace my 15+ year old Bang and Olufsen cartridge. I began researching cartridges via reviews, manufacturer websites, etc., and found the task to be daunting. As it is virtually impossable to find decent customer reviews for cartridges for under $300, I felt I needed to write one, so here goes...My system; Marantz 2252B receiver (you can't beat pre-1980s Marantz for true analog sound), Mirage Omni 60 speakers, Technics SL1200 direct drive turntable.I admit that I am sort of a vinyl snob. I own tons of CDs, they're practical for the car and readily available, but I prefer the sound of a clean well cared for vinyl LP given the proper playing conditions. You might call me an audiophile who doesn't have the funding for a high end system. The Shure M97xE more than fits my budget.I have been using The Shure M97xE for about a month now, listening to approximately 1-2 LPs a night, and I am quite impressed and content with my purchase. The cartridge comes with a 'dynamic stabilizer' brush mounted on the front that can be utilized or kept in the up position. This serves to stabilize the stylus under less than perfect playing conditions. I use it at all times, because it reduces static and collects dust, resulting in less build up on the stylus. I listen to everything from Dexter Gordon to the Clash to Weather Report to Bowie. I am extremely pleased so far with my purchase. It's great to exerience nuances of records that I have never heard before. The first album I played was Joe Jackson's Night and Day, and it sounded great. I heard background passages that I did not know existed on that record. I also noticed the stereo seperation to be a bit more pronounced than on the CD version of Night and Day. Next I put on a new copy of Salt and Pepper by Sonny Stitt and Paul Gonsalves. I hear crisp highs and feel the low lows. By my estimation, the sound from high to low and througout the midrange is fairly balanced, maybe slightly bassy. I forgot how rich the vinyl sound is compared to CD. For what it's worth, it also glides through some (but not all) pop and scratches that are in some of my older pressings without picking them up. Maybe it's the stabilizer. I am tracking at 1.75.I have a discerning ear, and understand how music should sound, as far as seperation, depth, production values and so on.Okay, I have never owned a $5000 cartridge, and therefore do not have that frame of reference, but I have experienced high end analog audio systems, and can say that for me this cartridge cuts it, at least in this price range. Actually I spent far less that I thought I would have to.The MSRP is $140."
Review 34,"If you do a search on my prior reviews, you will see that I have owned and/or tried several different golf GPS devices, and continually am searching for the perfect device. For the most part, nothing has touched my old Callaway MX (the original), until the batteries (even the replacement ones) would not hold a charge. The new MX held promise but didn't work for me well enough and it was returned after a round, leaving me for the past two seasons or so with the Garmin G.Over time, I came to wonder about the benefits of having distance on my wrist and giving up some of the other features. Make no mistake, there are pluses and minuses with the G2 Approach, and it just depends on what is most important to you, and what you're willing to live without. First, on to the details.In the Box: In the box comes the G2 watch, and very short quick start guide in like 500 languages and the charger clip. Like everybody else, I threw the box aside and proceeded to figure it out on my own. Charged in a few hours, no problem. The clip charger is not ideal, because it's kind of bulky (though light), but it's not that big of a deal. The clip is attached to USB, so you can charge it off your laptop, or from your little Apple USB charger box. Charges pretty quickly.The Fit: I wear a larger heart rate monitor type watch (Suunto), so the Garmin is really no bigger than what I wear every day. The watch band is comfortable, and I didn't have to synch it too tight. Overall, I don't even notice it when I play, same thing as every day, so the fit is a plus.The Display: I looked at the G3, because who doesn't want more pixels right? Well I said no to the extra $100 because I read the movable touch screen didn't work very well, and I could not see how it would work well, with the limited space on the face. The pixels are fine. I had no problem seeing the distances in the sun or the shade and found the resolution just fine.Ease of Use: This is where some of the tradeoffs come in. On my Garmin G6 handled, I of course could get easy distance to any particular piece of junk to carry or to any bunker as well as to any layup distance. On the G6 is is a simple matter of moving the cursor on the touch screen with my finger and it calculates distances to there and from there to the flag, and it was easy to pull the cursor to the red, white and blue lines to get layup distances to 100, 150 and 200. Also, the G6 gives me the ability to move the flag on the green to the particular hole location--all of which are nice.Now, on the G2, you can get distance to doglegs, and layups to 100, 150, 200, which is a fine amount of data to have (more than I really need) and the closest thing to a ""complaint"" I have about doing so on the G2 approach is the way you have to work the buttons to do it. Having said that, it's a minor complaint because the FAR FAR biggest advantage of the G2 is having your distances with you all the time--and I mean ALL THE TIME. There is no wake up function to wake the watch up from a sleep, no digging out the device from your pocket or sitting on the buttons my mistake and having it turn itself off or advance you to other screens without your knowledge. The G2 simply switches holes (advances holes) automatically for you when you get near the tee box and it's flawless. There's no digging out the device and having to go back a few holes and if your course starts you on the back side instead of the front, it just knows it. A huge plus. You just look at your wrist no matter where you are, and your distances to the front, center and back of the greens are just there in easy to read format. In my view, the proliferation of GPS and laser devices have kind of over complicated things because rather than getting a distance to the front, center and back, we too often get precise distances to the very spot of the flag (whether from GPS like the G6 or a laser), and we pull a club to that distance without factoring in the bounce and roll. Anyway, the front, center and back view on the G2 is great, and I wouldn't even want a scrollable or movable flag any more.On to the minor complaint: There are a lot of button presses here. More than there should be. You hold the button to start a round. No worries there. To move from ""hole view"" to ""layup"" view, you have to hit a button again, but there is no ""back key"" and there should have been. Similarly, to score your round--and it only scores a single player's scores so you lose the score to add up scores for your pals, you have to press AND hold the OK button, scroll a menu of a few items to reach ""SCORECARD,"" then hit the OK button again, which brings you to the hole you are on, and then you have to hit OK again to confirm you are entering the score on the right hole, press the up or down arrows to enter your score, press OK again, and then press AND hold the OK button until the menu comes up so you can hit CANCEL. You get used to it, but I have to say that without the ability to enter the entire foursome's scores, having the ability to enter scores on the watch loses some of its utility. True you can plug it into your computer and download your scorecard, and maybe that's valuable for you. After a few rounds, I decided to ditch scoring on this device and purchased a scorecard holder and went back to paper and pencil. Similarly, getting the ""layup"" distance requires a few button clicks too. You have to hit and hold the OK button, and then it brings you to 150 and 200 layup distances; well, I like to layup inside of 100 so bringing up the layup to 100 also involves hitting the up or down arrow key, and I'm not really sure how to get it back to the hole view when I am done.All the G2 needs is a dedicated scorecard button (bringing up the scorecard on a single button) and a back key that would take you to wherever you were before you hit the menus. If it did that, it would be nearly perfect.Satellite Acquisition: The G2 is far faster to acquire and hold the satellites than my G6, the Callaway MX Pro, the Callaway MX. Fast and no issues. Found my course right away too.Battery Life. Rated at 3 weeks for watch only and 8 hours for GPS. It claims to have a power save feature, but I couldn't see how to enable it and wouldn't want to, because having the distances without having to push a button to wake the device was partly why I wanted it. In GPS mode, however, I was less than 50 percent down after a 4.5 hour round, so getting 36 out of this might be tough. I don't play more than 18 too frequently, so this shouldn't be too much of an issue for me.Pluses: Small, lightweight, easy to read, and always on and have distances right there with you without having to wake the device or advance holes. Price is reasonable for what you get.Minuses: You trade some of the things you may like, such as distance to any bunker, distance to carries over trouble, and a movable flag to position flag on the greens. A few non-intuitive or repetitive button presses especially if you are entering scores. Battery life bears watching if you frequently play 36 a day.Net Summary: I am happy with this purchase, because I was ready to give up a movable flag and distances to bunker and other hazards in exchange for always having the numbers available without having to dig a device out of my pocket or mistakenly hitting buttons when it was in my pocket. It is worth it to me, because I really liked having my distances without any effort (marking your drives is exceedingly easy too). Depends upon what you are looking for and what you are willing to give up. I no longer need to see a birds eye view of the holes (and could get that off the paper score card anyway), and am ""going back to basics"" just having a number to the front, center, and back. It is helping my game not to get too precise distances to hole locations anyway, and causing me to think about whether I want to land it short or long. It's worth a look."
Review 35,"Let me start off by saying the this tv does not produce the best image out of the box. It is about right for the price range though.I upgraded from a 32 inch LCD Sharp from 2008. My old tv IS a great tv, even though it is 8 years old it still blows a lot of today's tv's out of the water as far as image quality goes. Yeah, it didn't have the same contrast ratios offered by today's tv's but even then it still managed to look amazing. It is a very high standard to beat. The only issue was the size, it just wasn't big enough for our needs. I was originally looking for another sharp but with their withdrawal from the American market, all the sharps still available were out of my price range.Let's start of with appearance. The tv looks nice, it's got a very thin bezel, about 3/8 of an inch vs over an inch for the old sharp. It isn't as thin as other led/lcd tv's I've seen but that's a non issue. It's about as thin as the old 32 inch which was ccfl backlit vs LED. It has a relatively small footprint as the it stands on two angled feet vs a rectangular base. It allows for things to be placed under it vs around it. Overall very nice.Performance, this is a bit of a difficult one, out of the box the tv looks ok. It is very bright but Colors are a bit off and washed out, especially yellows, they have a VERY green tint to them. This is especially noticeable when tv is set to game mode as it turns off any filters or extra processes and gives you a raw image and it looks pretty awful. Yellows turn into a pale sickly green. Unfortunately the color management system is forced off when in game mode so it is unfixable. For my gaming calibrations I had to use the ""expert""mode which allows you to pretty much change everything, after a lot of calibration and tinkering with specific colors I got it to look good, this was with a special calibration disk I use for tv's. One great thing about the calibration settings is that each setting is exclusive per input. For example, if I calibrate the ""movie"" mode for input 1 it won't change the ""movie"" calibration for any other input unless you select the ""apply to all inputs"" option. This is very useful as it allows you to calibrate the image for the specific device connected. After complete calibration however, the tv managed to look better than my old tv which is saying something. The viewing angle for the tv is decent. It has a cone of about 60-70¡ from the center of the tv before the contrast and colors begin to have a noticeable impact. This is a downgrade from my old 32"" as that tv had about a 90¡ cone before any noticeable changes in color and contrast happened.I'm assuming this is because it's just a bigger screen. The tv is still viewable from any angle but starts to lose image quality almost as soon as you are not directly in front of it. Simply put, At about a 5 foot distance away from the tv you can be about 2 feet in either direction from the center of the tv before you start to see change in image quality.The range gets smaller as you get closer and bigger as you get further. Overall, once calibrated the image is top notch and looks quite beautiful.4K, as I do not have any 4K devices all I could do is use the built in YouTube app to see 4K and it looks nice, crisp and as clear as a YouTube video could get in 4k. I definitely will not be using it's 4k capabilities any time soon. I wasn't looking for a 4k tv regardless and it's nice to know I have the option.Sound, the built in speakers are decent from what I can tell but I have all my devices hooked up to a surround sound system bypassing the tv's speakers. Because of this the tv's speakers aren't synchronised with the surround sound so I just have the sound off on the tv(it was the same with the other tv, so it's not the tv's fault)Everything else like the Wi-Fi and extra features work as advertised, no issues as of yet. I will update if anything changes.I would've given it 5 stars but having to go through a lot of calibration was it's weakness and I can't imagine a lot people that would want to go through all that to get the best picture."
Review 36,"Blue Yeti Review SummaryThe Blue Yeti is an excellent plug and record USB microphone that has dramatically increased the quality of my voice recordings. It has a solid & sleek build, is easy to use, and most importantly clearly records my voice.Introduction - Who I am and how do I use this productMy name is Antonio and I own and operate ATailoredSuit.com; I have been using the Blue Yeti since February to speak with clients on Skype and to record podcasts and videos about men's style and custom clothing. Prior to owning the Blue Yeti I used the Blue Snowflake for one year; before that I used the built in microphone on my computer and headsets. For the last 6 months I have been looking at purchasing the Blue Snowball; when this microphone came out I decided to make this purchase instead.Pros - Things I Love1. Sound Recording Quality - The most important quality in a microphone; from my limited 30 day use and when compared to the past types of microphones I am used to (Blue Snowflake, Logitech Webcam 9000 Microphone, Various Headset microphones, Built in Computer Microphones) this Microphone beat them all.2. Plug and Play - I have seamlessly used this microphone on 3 separate computers, one running XP, the other Vista, and on a Windows 7 machine. In each case it was immediately recognized and clearly marked as the Blue Yeti3. Simple Knobs and Design - Mute, Mode, Headphone Volume and MIC Gain Control. Stand can be tightened and microphone removed.4. Solid Build - Overall, Solid (One small complaint below). The 10 foot USB cord was a nice touch.5. Playful Approach - Blue has decided to present the Yeti in a playful manner. They appeal to the creative and make the manual much more approachable for those of us not technically inclined.Cons - Things I am not happy with1. Size - It weight 3.5 pounds and stands 1 foot high - I am used to this now, but be prepared for a big footprint!2. Looseness of Volume & Gain Controls - A small complaint, but for an overall solid device these feel like they will be the first things to break.Final RecommendationThe Blue Yeti is an amazing microphone that was well worth the investment. It has already dramatically increased the quality of my voice recordings and I recommend it to any podcaster. I give this product 9 out of 10 stars (5 out of 5 for Amazon!), my only knock that the price maybe too high for some."
Review 37,"While I didn't get the Typhoon H from Amazon, I do actually have my hands on my very own Yuneec Typhoon H. It is my very first multi-rotor (drone) and I must say I've done a fantastic job picking this drone up.For those that don't want to wait for the details below, here is the bottom line. GET IT. Rock solid, stable, nimble, but also easy to fly. There are a few minor issues, but nothing that impedes safety, functionality, or performance. Camera quality is great, GPS lock and extra functionality with the ST16 controller is stellar. Range is perfectly adequate for LEGAL usage of this camera platform and once you have received your Section 333 exemption it is easy enough to reconfigure for whatever your legal needs are.Now, here is a more in-depth review:Out of the box this is impressive - it is compact but looks almost alien once the 6 arms are extended and clicked into place. Next, you click on the propellers - 3 each of the 'A' and 'B' blades following the color coordinated posts - put the blade in place and give it a quick 1/4 turn to click and lock in place. Next, slide the battery in place, remove the camera gimble lock, and you are good to go.BUT WAIT!!! I didn't talk about the other critical part of this package - the ST16. And you need to have it turned on BEFORE you power up the camera platform. OK - here are the details. Everything you've read is true. This controller is BEAUTIFUL. It is very large, but it is not heavy. Measurements are 6.75""x13""x1.5"". The sides where you hold the controller are slightly thicker and rounded to provide extra comfort. The center is dominated by a 7"" android tablet. It is bright, clear, and crisp and provides all of the pertinent details the pilot needs to navigate the drone and control the camera. During flight, a quick double tap on the screen eliminates all of the other details and provides just the view from the camera - very helpful when trying to line up that perfect shot. The left of the controller has a 'D' pad that looks like it was pulled right off of an old-school Nintendo system. Just to the right is the button for taking still photos. Above the D pad is the standard RC control stick. Out of the box, this is configured in Mode 2 so this stick controls elevation and rudder (up/down, and rotation left or right). Next above that are the controls for camera panning - a twist knob and a couple of different switches for different modes/styles of camera control. On the very top on the left side is a big red button - this is the engine start/stop button and is pretty self-explanatory.On the right side is another 'D' pad and the button to start/stop video recording. Above that is the RC control stick that controls pitch forward/back/left/right (basic direction control). Above that are the switches for flight modes (Smart/Angle), and obstacle avoidance. On the very top on the right is the coolest switch - the switch for the landing gear. Yeah - it's just awesome.The two antenna are on the top of the controller for connection to the camera feed and the remote control unit. They are easy to fold away or fold open for flight operations. On the back are two circular sliders - the one on the left controls the angle up/down on the camera while the one on the right controls the expo rates (speed) of the drone itself.OK - now that all of that is out of the way, it's time to FLY!!! Kind of..... First, power up the controller. Boot time is around 2 minutes which seems like an hour when you are just really excited to get this up in the air. Once it's up, power on the drone by holding the power button for a couple of seconds and wait while the drone starts making all kinds of cool start up noises. The lights will flash and the start-up process will take another couple of min to finalize. During this time, the screen on the controller will indicate it is connecting to the drone and WiFi for the live video feed. Once it's connected, you are good to go, right? Not quite yet...... Last step is to perform a calibration on the drone. Tap the 'GPS Calibration' and then 'calibrate' icon on the controller. Lights on two arms will flash. Hold one in each hand and rotate the drone away from you until the lights stop flashing. Two different lights will flash so you grab those and repeat. Do this several times until the drone is back pointing the way it was when you started. The drone will beep indicating calibration is complete. OK - finally! NOW it is time to fly!!Step away from the drone 15-20 feet and press and hold the red button on the controller. The engines will start and you can slowly push up on the left control stick to take off! Alternately, you can also press the 'task' button on the controller and tap 'take off'. Once you've reached your desired altitude, take your fingers off of the control sticks and the drone will simply hover there.As this is my first drone, I'm not sure I'm fit to give a play by play of how to control the drone. I will say that it was very simple to control both in 'turtle' and 'rabbit' modes and in 'smart' and 'angle' mode. Smart mode uses the GPS on both the controller and the drone to direct the drone without reference to the direction the 'front' of the drone is facing. 'Angle' mode gives you much more control over the drone, but you will have to pay attention to where the 'front' of the drone is while you are piloting it.After you've had your fun, it's time to land. You can flip the switch to 'home' mode and the drone will automatically head to the controller. Once it is there, press down on the left stick and the drone will slowly decend until it rests on the ground. Alternately, you can actively pilot the drone (using Smart or Angle) mode until you are above your desired landing site. Use the left stick to lower the drone until it is resting on the ground. Once it's down, pres the red button for a couple of seconds and the engines are off.The video I got during my maiden flight today was beautiful and it should be attached to this review.I expect this drone to last me through years of hobbist (and potentially commercial) use. The components are built well, sturdy, and should last as long as you take care of it and treat it with respect.Now - on to the items that are less than stellar. #1 - DOCUMENTATION. No manual is included in the kit. The kit does have a quick start guide, basic do's and don'ts etc, but no manual. Fine - I figured I could go to Yuneec's site and download the manual from there. Nope. The 'manual' link there simply takes you back to the main Yuneec page. After hours and hours of digging I finally located a manual on a foreign Yuneec site (German) but the manual is in English. I found it to be very helpful, but there are still a lot of items that simply take some trial and error to determine how to make them work. The next thing that could use some tweaking are the LED's on the bottom of the drone. In less than full sun I could see it well but in the sun it's almost impossible to see. Lastly, it's the 'D' pads on the controller. They are completely useless. They can't do anything and are simply there for decoration. I wish there was SOMETHING they could configure these to do, some task they could perform. Perhaps some form of macros? Press one side and it automatically configures a specific camera setting or goes to CCC configuration or something. Nothing that detracts from actual purpose BUT..... if it's there, it should be able to actually perform some task.These items are minor and can be easily addressed and/or worked around. They don't detract from the fun this drone can provide.*UPDATE*First off - I've updated the video but Amazon compression killed it again. It does not look like that anywhere else I've played it. Secondly, I've now flown my Typhoon for 7.3 hours according to my log book. All flights have come off without a hitch, hiccup, or incident of any kind. I've flown in wind as gusty as 15-20mph and it was able to hold a steady hover no problem. Everything on the drone still looks brand new and operates the same as it did right out of the box. The only thing I think I'll need is an extra battery or two and an extra MicroSD card for capturing video. I've also been able to meet several other 'drone' owners and have flown a few other drones. While the DJI drones do seem to be a little quicker, I've yet to see anything the DJI Phantom (2, 3, or 4) can do that I can't do with the Typhoon H. Still very glad I made this purchase!"
Review 38,"The Epson Home Cinema 1040 is a decent projector for it's price, throws a decent picture by default, fantastic if you calibrate it, but has some build quality issues (See build quality section in lower part of review). I would suggest this for Computer use (to take advantage of the WUXGA resolution) with occasional movies and netflix/amazon instant video.Pros:- 3LCD - no rainbow effect that single chip DLPs have.- 3000 lumens - Bright, great for use in rooms with ambient light.- MHL (Mobile High-Definition Link) support- Low replacement lamp prices & Long lamp life- Corner Keystone & Auto vertical Keystone (for portable use, not for home cinema use, see more below)- 1920x1200 WUXGA native resolution - great for computer use- 2 year warranty with two business-day replacement with free shipping (from Epson)Cons:- Auto-Iris for higher contrast, audible grinding noise even on high speed setting- 1920x1200 WUXGA native resolution - not so great for 1080p content (Netflix, Prime Video, FireTV, etc.)- Negative throw offset: this is the relationship between position of projected image and projector. For ceiling mounting, you WILL need a mount with extension tube.- Long throw distance compared to other projectors (the projector needs to be placed further away from the screen for a bigger picture)- Not so great build quality - Foreign material on 3LCD - read below and see picture.- Speaker is weak, but you're expected to use a sound system- No Lens shift (which allows for flexible placement of projector), though expected at this price pointPicture Quality:- The Epson Home Cinema 1040 has decent picture quality even in daylight. Colors look real in cinema mode, really detailed on highlights, however, lacking in shadows of the image.- If you calibrate the the color settings using Cinema or Game Mode as the starting point, you can get it to look fantastic, though lack of detail in shadows still exists.- Dynamic mode does not work well for video. On scenes like the in-car shot scenes of House of Cards where the lighting changes on the actor's face, the projector showed it struggled to maintain a color balance, causing skin tones to fluctuate between bright, lifelike and blue. Works great for computer use and web browsing though.- The WUXGA 1920x1200 resolution is weird for a home cinema projector. If you are mostly using this for movies or 1080p content, i'd suggest you purchase Epsons' other home cinema projector, the 2040, which is 1920x1080 in resolution. The extra 120 vertical pixels causes a letterbox whenever you're watching 1080p content, unless you dismiss the extra 120 pixels and position the image on your screen without the extra 120 pixels, but that raises an issue of light being thrown outside of your projection screen.Features - Pretty good, though some are compensations:- Auto-Vertical keystone & Corner keystone, if you're using this projector not as a home cinema projector, but carries it around, plops it on a table and gives presentations, this is great. This is a useless feature if you are mounting it for home use, because you do not want to use any keystone correction as keystone at all as it alters the 1:1 pixels mapping, lowering the quality of your image.- 3LCD, Great for people sensitive to the rainbow effect of single chip DLP projectors.- 3000 lumens, Great for use with ambient light. My previous BenQ W1070 gets completely washed out with lights on. The Epson Home Cinema 1040 still throws a decent picture on ECO mode with lights on.- LONG lamp life, Up to 10,000 hours on ECO mode, and Up to 5,000 hours on Normal mode.Build Quality - Roll the dice and see if you get a good one - feels unpolished:- The air filter that prevents dust from getting into the lens and LCD structure does not have any sort of seal around the filter (it's loosely seated in a slot covered by a flimsy plastic cover that doesn't sit flush with the casing), possibly allowing larger dust to enter the system as time goes on. Unfortunately, I have this issue out of the box. There's a dust blob on the blue LCD of the 3LCD system, creating a dark spot on blue images, and thus a yellow blob on full color picture. *See picture attached* (It does come with a 2 year warranty, so if dust gets into the system after Amazon's exchange & return period, Epson will fix it for you).- Use the built in speaker, at a decent volume (above 1), and you'll hear rattling of loose fitting parts from the vibrations of the speaker. (This isn't much of an issue because you'll have your own sound system)- Tap the lamp cover on top and you'll notice it's not secured by any latches and is simply held on by the side screw.- Fan noise is quiet on ECO mode, very very loud on Normal mode. This projector uses Epson's quick shutdown technology where the fan stops immediately after power-off, and does not do a controlled cooldown of the lamp to prolong it's life. This allows you to quickly unplug the projector and pack it up and move it somewhere else. I didn't see a setting for this and wished it was included.Overall, the Epson Home Cinema 1040 is a respectable projector with decent and bright image quality.Though for reasons of build quality, I would not recommend it."
Review 39,"I admit that I was a little skeptical when Amazon first introduced its Echo device. But I decided to buy one anyway, thinking that if I didn't like it I could easily sell it. After all, back in the early days of the Echo it was in very high demand. So the financial risk associated with trying it was minimal. Today, as an avid music listener who loves to cook, I'm thrilled that I decided to give the Echo a try.I had wanted a device that I could stream music with in the kitchen, and the EchoÕs hands-free voice control made it very appealing. But how would it sound?? That question was quickly answered as soon as I set up and started using my Echo. The fact is, I was absolutely blown away by how great it sounded; and how well it worked.I grew very used to the many features of the Echo, but I wanted to take them with me when I left the kitchen. And as wonderful as the Echo is, itÕs not very portable. ThereÕs this little thing called a plug that has to remain in the wall in order for it to work.Enter the new Amazon Tap.The biggest reason I was so excited when Amazon announced the new Tap was because of its portability. With a rechargeable battery that offers up to 9 hours of playback, along with its compact size, the Tap is made to be taken places. I can now carry all of the fabulous features that I have on my Echo into other rooms of my house, the backyard, the patio, the garage, or even places away from home.I mentioned before that I listen to a lot of music, and I happily pay a small annual fee to store all of my music in AmazonÕs Cloud. As a result, I can take my entire music collection anywhere I go, and itÕs available to play at the touch of a button. (Yes, you have to push a button on the Tap before you can tell it your instructions, but thatÕs a very small price to pay for total portability.)I was hopeful that the TapÕs sound would be as good or better than the EchoÕs, and I was not disappointed. With its dual stereo speakers and 360-degree omni-directional audioÑwith DolbyÑthe Tap sounds AMAZING! Trust me: IÕm pretty fussy when it comes to how my music sounds and I am blown away by what I hear coming from the Tap. I own a Bose wireless Bluetooth speaker that IÕve used for streaming music and I can honestly say that prefer the sound of the Tap. Some people may think the Tap doesn't have enough bass response, but I think the overall tone is just right.What makes the Tap even more impressive is its compact size. This thing is a cylinder thatÕs only 6Ó tall and 2-1/2Ó in diameter. And itÕs loaded with dynamic sound and a boatload of voice-controlled features. With Tap, I can play music from my library, Amazon Prime Music, Pandora, IHeartRadio, Spotify, and other sources. I can ask it to tell me the news, the weather, or the score of my favorite sports teamÕs game. I can ask it what the status of its battery is. I can even use it to order a pizza or control my WiFi thermostat (I have the Sensi Wi-Fi Programmable Thermostat 1F86U-42WF for Smart Home, Works with Alexa). It really is an amazing device. It even functions as a Bluetooth speaker for streaming music from any Bluetooth-enabled device.As expected, the build of the Tap is top-notch. Amazon has certainly become a quality device maker, and the Tap shows off that fact beautifully. Its design is simple and intuitive. The Talk button is easily accessible on the front of the unit and the playback controlsÑPlay/Pause, Previous/Next, and Volume Up/DownÑare right on top. In addition to the microphone, there are also five LED indicator lights on top, and they pleasingly light up as necessary to show that the Tap is responding. The Power button, a 3.5mm audio input, Micro-USB port, and WiFi/Bluetooth button reside on the back of the unit. (Note: There is no headphone jack, which is a bit surprising for a portable device.) The bottom of the Tap is non-slip rubber, and the top is smoother rubber. The sides are covered with a fabric mesh.Setup of the Tap is virtually effortless. The device went from its impressive packaging to being up and running in about 3 or 4 minutes. The Alexa iOS app really is fantastic and makes setup a breeze. (I wish more makers of WiFi-enabled devices would learn a thing or two from Amazon in this regard.)My only concern about the Tap is a relatively small one: IÕm just not sure how well it will hold up over time. If IÕm going to be carrying this little baby around everywhere I go, IÕm hoping that it will withstand minor bumps or drops. I did order an Amazon Tap Sling Cover - Black for it, and I think that will help keep it safe. But the one big drawback of the sling cover is that the Tap wonÕt fit into the charging cradle while itÕs in the sling. You can still charge the Tap by using the Micro-USB connection in the back, but the convenience of the charging cradle is lost. And thatÕs a shame, because the charging cradle is a nice, simple way to charge the device. I wish Amazon couldÕve thought of a way to protect the Tap while allowing you to use the charging cradle, too. (Also, maybe supplying an optional lanyard would've been nice.) One more thought: I wonder a bit about the lifespan of the battery. After all, I don't think it's replaceable.All in all, I couldnÕt be much happier with the Amazon Tap. It really is the EchoÕs little sister, and it gives me all the functionality of the Echo with one big bonus: total portability. Some people might be put off by having to push the Talk button in order to communicate with the Tap, but like I said before: ThatÕs a very small price to pay in exchange for being 100 percent cord-free. At the introductory price of $129.99, the Amazon Tap is an incredible bargain. ItÕs one of the coolest technological devices IÕve ever owned. As great as the Echo is, in my mind the Tap is even better. Alexa, IÕm in love all over again.UPDATE Re: Durability (4/13/16): A few minutes ago, one of my cats knocked my Tap off of a table in the living room. The Tap, which was streaming music from the cloud, fell about three feet, directly onto a hardwood floor. I have to say, I was more than a little bit worried. But the Tap kept right on playing and there is absolutely no damage to it at all. And my Tap is totally naked (I do not use the protective Sling with it). This makes me feel pretty good about the overall durability of the Tap. :)UPDATE (5/3/16): I still love the Tap, but there's one thing I've found very annoying. I've been using it on my bedside table of late to play music while I'm falling asleep. Unfortunately, the Tap's power button is lit up by a very bright LED, and it stays lit while music is playing. If my head is close to the table next to my bed--and it frequently is, because I sleep on my side--the light is a distraction. So I've had to move the Tap down to the floor to get the light away from my face. I wish they would've chosen a more muted light for the power button. Or maybe provided an option to dim or turn off the light completely."
Review 40,"I was lucky enough to have received the Fitbit Charge HR prior to it's scheduled release. In 2014 wearable technology has been the craze. I've been using the Fitbit Flex because our hospital was providing a subsidy to help the employees get fit. Now the Flex is not the best wearable. I currently have the Pebble, Moto 360 and I've used the Samsung Gear Live and Basis. The Flex by far is the most convenient one to use. But the Flex does have it's limitations and issues with the battery. So when the Charge HR was announced, I was extremely excited to see what it can provide. Compared to the Flex, it is twice the thickness and the strap is now a buckle.So far I've been impressed with the results of the Charge HR. I'll list the pros and cons.Pros:Auto Sleep Log: Much more convenient than having to start and stop on the Flex. I don't always fall asleep when I logged it with the Flex so having the Charge HR start it when I actually fall asleep is great.Logging Exercise: I love the ability to log each workout session. With the Flex I felt that my strength training sessions were lost because they weren't constant hand swinging movements. I can also better track how long my workout sessions were. This leads into my next pro.HR Monitor:The HR Monitor is a constant and checks your resting heart rate vs when you are active. This is great for calculating your caloric burn and if you want to see where your fat burning zone is. I think this provides a great tool to track your workouts more accurately.Stair Counter:This is a great motivator to take the stairs. I was taking the stairs with the Flex but it didn't capture that accurately. I go up 6 flights of stairs to my office at least 3 times a day and would like credit for that.Caller ID:This is a good function to have but for me it's not a deal breaker. But if you are like me and keep your phone on silent, it is always good to have something on your hand vibrate when you get a call. It takes a second or so to get the notification, but it's useful to have.Now for the Cons or areas of improvement.Cons:The buckle on the strap feels cheap. It's suppose to be surgical steel but feels more like hard plastic. Having to put the Charge HR an inch above the wrist can be annoying. I think it would be a little better to have the heart rate monitor on the underside of the wrist where you would feel your pulse.The best thing that Fitbit can do is to have a better charging mechanism. If they can allow it's devices to wirelessly charge, that would be great. That would be a huge plus because you don't have to mess with plugs. Just place it on the plate and let it charge. This a great feature with the Moto 360 and makes it so much easier to have multiple charging plates at home, in the office and in my travel bag.The last thing that I would expect from Fitibit is a better instruction manual. With the new added features of the Charge HR, I would like to maximize the use. Luckily I was able to figure things out quickly, but for the people who are not as tech savy might get frustrated trying to go through the functions. Of course the app is great and it's even better that it syncs with MyFitnessPal.Overall I think the Charge HR is a great step up from the Flex and sits on the same level as other advanced wearables. I think it's worth the investment and would be a great gift for someone who plans to get into shape. I'm a strong believer that you need to track in order to get the results that you want. For the average person; If you don't know what you did today, you won't be able to progress tomorrow.With a proper diet, Fitbit has helped me lose 30 lbs in 11 weeks. Seeing what my results was a great motivator. The weight was not water weight but actual fat. From a 1 keg ab to 6 pack abs, it's worth every penny."
Review 41,"I also need to give a couple major kudos to Amazon. First, they double boxed the shipment which is a service that some places charge $30-75 for and others don't even offer. And second, they took care of me when Samsung not only extended the original sale past 6/13, but then included a free soundbar or 24"" TV with every purchase."
Review 42,"Instead of returning it, since I had thrown away the box, I decided to call Samsung and use the warranty. It took them 5 days to get a technician to my home (Technical Difficulties was the company, out of Green Bay Wisconsin). The tech determined it was a defective screen and they would order another one. That was on a Monday. The next week, on Tuesday, after not hearing from them I called Difficulties. They informed me the order for the screen hadn't been put in until the previous Thursday so it won't arrive until Friday, which will be over two weeks since it broke."
