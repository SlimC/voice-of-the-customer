"I got my new UN65JS8500 last Tuesday after I accidentaly broke my XBR55X850A, well accidents happens.",Sentiment,
Once you properly calibrate your set be ready to be amazed.,Sentiment,
"I watched The Dark Knight, Pacific Rim and Transformers 4: Age of Extinction, three of my favorite Reference movies on Blu Ray.",Sentiment,
I did way to many hours of research leaning towards discounted 2014 models as I'm basically done paying extra for being an early adopter of new technology.,Sentiment,
I needed a TV now and am willing to watch the price drop in the coming year.,Sentiment,
If your considering this TV my recommendation is go for it!,Sentiment,
I purchased this TV about 2 weeks ago and I can't say enough good things about it.,Sentiment,
But I will warn you it takes some time of working through all of its features before you get this picture.,Sentiment,
If you have a Xbox One or PS4 you will see a drastic difference as well.,Sentiment,
I play Destiny on Xbox One and it looks amazing.,Sentiment,
One thing you will have to do with FPS or action games is switch over to game mode every time.,Sentiment,
The other model I looked very closely at was the new Sony model in the same 55 inch set.,Sentiment,Comparison
But I have watched a fair number or blu rays the past two weeks and they look stunning.,Sentiment,
One that was particularly amazing was Lucy.,Sentiment,
This seems to be a common problem with this model.,Sentiment,
I've seen other people complain about this issue online.,Sentiment,
I filed a support ticket at Samsung.com and attached the images showing the problem.,Sentiment,
I also called Sumsung Support and referenced my online support ticket ID number.,Sentiment,
I am very pleased with the final result.,Sentiment,
I have owned the TV for 6 weeks now and it works flawlessly.,Sentiment,
I didn't even buy the TV for the 3D capability.,Sentiment,
But I am so happy I did.,Sentiment,
I bought additional open box Samsung 3D glasses online at BestBuy.com for $9.99.,Sentiment,
I normally look to upgrade every 2-3 years and this process is usually a very simple one - checkout the offerings from Sony & Samsung and select the best option.,Sentiment,
"But other advances in technology, both those that are here and those that are arriving soon (hopefully) made this process much more involved and a bit befuddling at times.",Sentiment,
What did was HDR because I believe that could be a game changer.,Sentiment,
"It also narrowed the search down to two Samsung models, the JS8500 or JS9000, and I don't think you can go wrong with either one.",Sentiment,Comparison
"But you can't upgrade the panel, so I would rather use the $500 difference in price along with the future evolution kit upgrade ($400+) and whatever you can sell the JS8500 for and put that towards a new TV when the time comes.",Sentiment,
"Anyway, it's only been a few days but so far I am extremely happy with the JS8500.",Sentiment,
But any of these can be easily upgraded and are not rating factors for me.,Sentiment,
"First, I did experience one issue with this set which was some flickering/flashlighting on the bottom of the screen that was very noticeable when watching movies in letterbox format.",Sentiment,
"process, so I loosened the 4 bottom screws by about a 1/4 turn (one needed more) and the problem has not returned.",Sentiment,
"I think most people will use this TV with one or more HDMI devices -- either an A/V receiver, set top box, Blu-Ray player, etc.",Sentiment,
"After initial setup, I got a couple of messages about problems with the HDMI connections.",Sentiment,
I think these were due to the One Connect cable being loose.,Sentiment,
"It's a tight fit, and you need to make sure it is firmly connected, with a final click.",Sentiment,
I've had the Samsung UN65JS8500 for 3 months now with no problems.,Sentiment,
I had an issue where none of the HDMI ports were working.,Sentiment,
"I thought maybe I would need a new one-connect box to fix this, but Samsung support (1) checked that I had the latest software, and (2) had me unplug the TV while it was ON; wait a bit, then re-plug it.",Sentiment,
"Hoping I was not one of those people, I ended up with that set.",Sentiment,
"bought this TV a month ago, and just returned it last week.",Sentiment,
"I can't believe that for a 2015 TV, and for this price, I would be experiencing this level of issues.",Sentiment,
"However, it has some drawbacks that might be significant to you, and there are other televisions that are much cheaper that you might consider.",Sentiment,
"You can still enjoy the content, as the screen can get very bright, but if you are bothered by this be aware.",Sentiment,
"so if you have a large room where people will be seated far off to the side, be aware, the screen gets very washed out unless you sit in front of it.",Sentiment,
"So, overall for me this was a good purchase, but there are definitely drawbacks that might be important enough for you to not consider this.",Sentiment,
I would check that out for sure and decide which is best for your preferences.,Sentiment,
IMO comparable Sony's or LG's are not worth considering.,Sentiment,
Check out the Official JS8500 thread on AVSForum for a bunch of customer photos that highlight the issue.,Sentiment,
I'm boxing it back up for a return.,Sentiment,
"I pick this up from Best Buy since they had there Black Friday prices available now, same as Amazon has it currently.",Sentiment,
"Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge LG fan, my last TV before this was an 55inch LG 1080p, with this TV I have no back lighting issues.",Sentiment,
"I have only watched one 3D movie so far (Gravity), it looked amazing.",Sentiment,
I have have two Monster Black Platinum HDMI cables connected.,Sentiment,
"One to my 2014 Samsung BD-F7500 4K Up-scaling 3D Blu-Ray player, and the other to my XBox One.",Sentiment,
"These HDMI cables are the best, I highly recommend getting them, I had these for about a year now connected to my 1080p TV, and they have done wonders for the picture on that set.",Sentiment,
"The cables are about a $100 a pop (plus tax), and they are worth it.",Sentiment,
"I have one with the LED indicator ($10 more), which tells me when the signal is in SD, HD, or 4K.",Sentiment,
I have only used this TV for one day and at this time only have it connected to an older digital cable box via a coax connection.,Sentiment,
I did use the Component connections for a DVD player and the picture quality is excellent.,Sentiment,
I will have a Mini Tivo box installed early next week and following that will have an HDMI cable tv connection.,Sentiment,
"I point this out because if you plan on using a USB device (such as thumb drive) to view media, you may want to obtain a USB extension cable, because if you have the TV against a wall, or in an enclosed cabinet like I do, the rear panel may not be easily accessible.",Sentiment,
Both the shipping carton and the product label on the rear of the TV clearly identify this TV as a UN24H4000 model.,Sentiment,
It appears that Samsung has revised the panel configuration of this model to match the separate UN24H4500 model.,Sentiment,
"Fold-outs are fine for the Setup and Quick Start guides, but I would much prefer a booklet style User Manual.",Sentiment,
"I had to use an set of angled hobby tweezers, and even that wasn't easy.",Sentiment,
"I was easily able to totally reconfigure by pressing the Menu key, scrolling down to a gear-shaped icon, which is Plug & Play, then pressing the Enter key.",Sentiment,
Putting it up high like that is a real plus for the bedroom.,Sentiment,
An older Visio 22 TV with a larger bezel and front mounted speakers did not fit into that space.,Sentiment,Comparison
I use this TV in the basement with a Roku 3 while working out on my bicycle trainer.,Sentiment,
I also plug my headphones into the remote on the Roku 3.,Sentiment,
I can't think of anything that I don't like about this TV.,Sentiment,
I would definitely buy this TV again and I probably will for the cabin.,Sentiment,
Just press a few wrong buttons and you'll figure it out.,Sentiment,
I replaced my flip phone for a not-so-smart phone (Samsung Galaxy Centura) and I replaced my old flat screen CRT TV for this.,Sentiment,
If I rotate it both my wife and I can see it fine.,Sentiment,
 I bought this TV for my elderly dad for Christmas.,Sentiment,
He spends a lot of time watching TV because he is differently abled and almost unable to walk.,Sentiment,
I bought it to replace a cheap TV he bought himself when his previous TV died.,Sentiment,
"My mom doesn't like the TV noise when he's watching and she's reading in the same room, so he uses headphones.",Sentiment,
"His illness gives him cognitive and memory issues, so he can't be going into the complex menu and clicking through an elaborate system of choices simply to switch from TV speakers to headphones.",Sentiment,
"I looked into hooking it up to a surround sound system, but my parents don't want speakers all over their den.",Sentiment,
"Honestly, I don't recommend this TV for elderly people or anyone who wants to use headphones.",Sentiment,
"My dad is waiting for me to solve his problem, and I think the only realistic way to do that is to get him a different TV.",Sentiment,
My mom is threatening to plug in the old one and put this one away.,Sentiment,
Honestly I wish I'd never purchased it.,Sentiment,
Everything met,Sentiment,
This was gift for my sister in nursing home.,Sentiment,
She loves it!!!,Sentiment,
 I have two Samsung tv's and can't say anything bad about either.,Sentiment,Comparison
We needed a small TV for our kitchen.,Sentiment,
this is the smallest I found with the features I wanted.,Sentiment,
Samsung is one of the brands that has an issue with the power on/off along with the STB.,Sentiment,
"This seems to have mixed reviews, but the negative ones did not seem to apply to me.",Sentiment,
"I won't balance it until its on for about 50 hours, but it looks essentially the same with the contrast down to 70%.",Sentiment,
I bought this TV before there was any feedback and found the negative feedback before it was delivered.,Sentiment,
It was a great buy and I am very pleased.,Sentiment,
"Love the features, don't need a Roku now :) Very pleased with this purchase and the size is perfect for my bedroom.",Sentiment,
"Almost bought a sound bar, but for the room, I don't even need it.",Sentiment,
At first I didn't have volume.,Sentiment,
I've had (and still have) several other Samsung TVs  and have liked them.,Sentiment,Comparison
"Remember picture tube TVs that used to take time to warm up?,",Sentiment,
Bought this tv for my mom 3months ago and it's already broken.,Sentiment,Product
"My old 51"" Samsung is going on 7 years without a problem, and is now in my living room to replace an LG TV I had out there",Comparison,Sentiment
"The Vizio M70-C3 i bought before this TV had way better backlight, with only 32 active LED full array zones, it out performed this samsung.",Comparison,Product
"I really wanted to like this TV, as I have a 52 Samsung 7000 series from 9 years ago on the wall, and it is still a very good TV.",Comparison,
"I can't believe these two tv's share the same tech for the most part, aside from the smart features, 3D, form factor, inch count and the nano crystals...I decided to go with the LG 65EG9600 to squash any of my gripes...and if that TV doesn't knock my socks off, I give up.",Comparison,
looks just the same as 1080p that my sister has.,Comparison,
"My old 51"" Samsung is going on 7 years without a problem, and is now in my living room to replace an LG TV I had out there",Comparison,Sentiment
"Comparing it to 4K TVs that cost three times as much, the picture is just as good for 1080p content",Comparison,Product
"One slightly disappointing thing is that I have a Samsung 46"" TV from 2010 that actually looks better.",Comparison,
The smaller Samsung has a little more function and the processors are noticeably quicker.,Comparison,
The LG model was cheaper than the Samsung,Comparison,Product
I decided against the Sony because of light bleed reports against the LG because it uses an IPS display while Samsung uses a VA display,Comparison,Product
To be honest I think my UN55JU7100 has a better picture.,Comparison,Product
Wasn't even as good as a curved I had in 2014.,Comparison,
"We also considered the Sony X930D, and although it may be a better unit, there wasn't enough to convince us it was worth another $700.",Comparison,Product
I had intended to buy a curved model but decided I liked this one better once I had a chance to compare side by side in a store.,Comparison,
This tv is more compared to the JS8500 just because the refresh rate is supposedly much higher than the JS7000 therefore you can't compare a 60Hz tv to a 120H,Comparison,Product
But image quality is not equal to my 50in js7000 this tries to replace,Comparison,Product
The JS8500 includes the One Connect Mini as oppose to the 9000 series which include the One Connect Box with more input options and future proof of the hardware.,Product,Comparison
"Also this set has a LED Edge-Lit backlight display as his more expensive brother the JS9000, only",Product,Comparison
I considered both the JS9000 & 9500 but I'm not a fan of curved TV's.,Product,Comparison
In the end I just couldn't pull the trigger on settling for what my eyes perceived to be an inferior picture to the JS8500.,Product,Comparison
I did an awful lot of research before buying a TV in this price range and through all my reading I saw that Hight Dynamic Range (HDR) was extremely important to future proof your investment and this TV has it.,Product,Sentiment
Both had amazing picture but the HDR coupled with the slightly better picture in my opinion I chose this model.,Product,Comparison
I turned on the UHD upscale and it creates a far better picture than my prior 50 inch LED 1080p TV.,Product,Comparison
"But the plan this time was even simpler - look for a great deal on a 2014 H7150/H8000 because the benefits of 4k are largely negated on the size I needed (46-50), and there are no high-end 1080P sets for 2015 in that size.",Product,Comparison
The 9000 is curved and has better sound but neither of those was a concern for me.,Product,Comparison
"Lastly, this might just be my imagination or another in a long line of senior moments, but the picture quality seemed to improve noticeably after the set had about 18-20 hours on it.",Product,Sentiment
"I find the blacks good, but not quite as good as my Vizio that is back lit.",Product,Comparison
"As for competition, the Vizio M series is much cheaper than this, 4k and full array back lit, with good blacks and other advantages as well.",Product,Comparison
"I originally planed on getting the LG 65UF8600, but I seen that LG has a lot of back light bleeding issues, and doing more research, I found that it is not to future proof or HDR compatible.",Product,Comparison
"I am mad that Samsung only decided to provide one single pair of 3D glasses, provided the amount of money we are spending ($2,000+), they could at least spare another 15 or 20 bucks and provide one more pair, guess I'll be watching by myself until I get some more!!!!",Product,Sentiment
I have a four-year-old Visio 22 1080 TV in another location and the picture from this Samsung with 720 is just as good if not better.,Product,Comparison
I specifically did not want a smart TV because a lot of the research I found was that most of them are laggy and freeze up.,Product,Sentiment
" but honestly, my Vizio's picture quality is better.",Product,Comparison
"If I own a Samsung TV, I prefer to have a NON-Smart TV.",Product,Comparison
"The 'frame' around the new model is much smaller, so you could fit this in a smaller space if needed - the old one filled the space.",Product,Comparison
"Great tv, and my 40 in living room is just as wonderful!",Product,Comparison
So far I am happy with this tv & all samsung products that I have purchased.,Product,Comparison
One reason I purchased this product was that the stand in the middle of the TV offers a small footprint vice the newer TVs with two stands located on each end.,Product,Sentiment
Picture quality is better than the 11yr old LCD TV it replaced and the sound was much better too.,Product,Comparison
"It honestly looks and plays better than my Samsung 27"" PC Monitor.",Product,Comparison
"Compared to the AppleTV, this has better picture quality",Product,Comparison
The sound quality is the same as the AppleTV,Product,Comparison
Bad motion blur and far less colors than the js7000 it aims to replace.,Product,Comparison
Compare this tv to any 2015 suhd tv and is hits major issues.,Product,Comparison
I'll update this review after I get more time using this TV.,Other,
I've attached a photo of a youtube 4k video taken with my samsung S5 phone.,Other,
I know many people say there isn't much 4K content out right now and that is fairly true.,Other,
The Samsung UN65JS8500FXZA TV arrived on November 12.,Other,
"However, the TV screen should have worked when purchased.",Other,
I should not have to replace a brand new screen.,Other,
"For that reason, I give 3 stars instead of 5.",Other,
"Okay, it is now December 30, 2015.",Other,
I attached an image showing Home Alone playing on the TV.,Other,
Please let me know if you have any questions.,Other,
Now I'd like to mention a few setup/installation items that might save some folks a little aggravation and maybe result in more accurate reviews.,Other,
But sometimes this is caused by the screws being over-tightened during the mfg.,Other,
Something to try before returning it.,Other,
"These can cause various problems with streaming, shutoffs, etc.",Other,
so try these individually after you have everything else setup/dialed in.,Other,
I know they say you shouldn't professionally calibrate it until after 100 hours so maybe this is related.,Other,
I also need to give a couple major kudos to Amazon.,Other,
"First, they double boxed the shipment which is a service that some places charge $30-75 for and others don't even offer.",Other,
"And second, they took care of me when Samsung not only extended the original sale past 6/13, but then included a free soundbar or 24 TV with every purchase.",Other,
Still enjoying the new TV and decided to have the set calibrated.,Other,
A lot of people have reviewed this set in detail.,Other,
"Rather than repeat that, here's a few words about the One Connect Mini box that is included.",Other,
"Once I did this, I had no more such problems.",Other,
Some people have been hating on the remote.,Other,
It seems pretty intuitive.,Other,
This cleared the problem.,Other,
 hope this helps people looking at this TV and I am happy to answer any questions you might have as it is a big investment for most and the technology can sometimes feel intimidating to some.\,Other,
(unless they were hiding with the stand.,Other,
Lets get to the BAD part.,Other,
"I will return it, and wait a few years.",Other,
"For me, the pros outweigh the cons.",Other,
Good luck.,Other,
Looks like many other users are reporting the same thing with recently purchased TVs.,Other,
like to be specific when I write reviews here as too often the reviews of multiple models/products get blended together.,Other,
This review is for the Samsung UN24H4000 24-Inch 720p 60Hz LED TV; Amazon ASIN: B00KSBBGA4.,Other,
"I purchased this product on Sept 6, 2014.",Other,
I will update my review following that.,Other,
(Note that a USB extension cable is NOT the same thing as a standard USB cable.),Other,
Another reason I point this out is the Amazon photos for this product clearly show a side panel with HDMI and USB ports.,Other,
I am certain that the photos come from Samsung as the same photos are shown at BestBuy.Com and Beach Audio.,Other,
All three of these are fold-outs.,Other,
I read in another review here on Amazon that you must be extremely careful with configuring the TV when you first turn it on because you only get one shot at it.,Other,
That person returned the set after a botched first attempt.,Other,
"By the way, I later learned that the vast majority of cable tv provider's signal are STD.",Other,
The IRC and HRC are noise reduction signals used mostly with older cable technology.,Other,
Other reviewers have complained about the sound from this model.,Other,
In both cases I'm getting way more bang for the buck.,Other,
My favorite things so far have to do with menu options.,Other,
4 stars easy.,Other,
Ditto bluetooth.,Other,
"Looked into sound bars, but sound bars don't have headphone jacks.",Other,
Too much of a pain to find something that works.,Other,
THANKS!,Other,
This one arrived very quickly and my son set it up for me.,Other,Sentiment
Don't trust Samsung with their smart TV's after what they have said about being careful on what you say around the TV since they listen in.,Other,
Watch TV.,Other,
Just an extra step that we Don't have to do with my other TV's.,Other,
Would I buy this again?,Other,
Unquestionably.,Other,
"I must admit that, based on the prior feedback, I was concerned about the feet as I tried to assemble the TV.",Other,
"Additionally, be smart and don't be influenced by reviews from people who are not verified purchasers of the product. ",Other,
"But after making those adjustments and restarting the tv, volume is great.",Other,
"Bought a wall mount, but unless you have a brick or concrete wall, it's unable to be used, so I have to return the mount.",Other,
"After adjusting settings and repowering I did.,",Other,
How can a TV be slow?,Other,
"On the back, the TV has the following ports:",Other,
"Other one larger, but same features.",Other,Comparison
Will buy again when we are in need again,Other,
"Ultimately, it comes down to how you intend to use this tv.",Other,
The only regret I have with buying this TV is not going for the model with the higher refresh rate.,Other,
Every thing else very good.,Other,
Arrived on time ....,Other,
So many choices when looking to buy a new TV for my bedroom.,Other,
I started comparing TVs,Other,
But then I began to look at this LG TV more closely,Other,
I am not a tech guru when it comes to TV‰Ûªs but here is what I have noticed after several weeks of using this TV:,Other,
Cons: none that I have noticed.,Other,
"I am enclosing three pictures, though the pictures do not fully show how clear the TV picture is.",Other,
I purchased a table (also from Amazon) with a 12 X 24 inch top.,Other,
"Purchased this TV from Amazon, as usual good delivery service.",Other,
It only has enough for one component though.,Other,
thanks so much,Other,
The first one arrived on time and in great shape.,Other,
I contacted Amazon who graciously shipped out another via 2 day shipping method which arrived on a Saturday.,Other,
Sure enough it has the same exact issue!,Other,
"For customers reading this please note that I am no amateur and own a RCA , SHARP, VIZIO and Westinghouse TV set.",Other,
I will be returning both defective TV's for a full refund.,Other,
Buyers beware.,Other,
"Side note, the products I purchased have a different stand than the one pictured here.",Other,
This was a really nice purchase here at Amazon.,Other,
Great buy!,Other,
"Since , the middle of February not 1 thing wrong and I leave it on ALL day literally I fall asleep to the noise of a t.v.",Other,
Would buy again .,Other,
If so it will be my go to brand in the future,Other,
I will leave a more detailed review after a few weeks of use.,Other,
A really great bonus!,Other,
I looked at manufacturer website and on 2016 models it says the 50 inch and above only have media player built in.,Other,
I also called Sumsung Support and referenced my online support ticket ID number.,Product,
"After speaking to several people and being disconnected once, Samsung arranged to have a local authorized repair technician come to my house and replace the TV screen on November 17.",Product,
I was on the phone for a total of two hours with Samsung and their agents to get the entire problem resolved.,Product,
"I thought maybe I would need a new one-connect box to fix this, but Samsung support (1) checked that I had the latest software, and (2) had me unplug the TV while it was ON; wait a bit, then re-plug it.",Product,
"Contacted Samsung and they deemed it to have ""physical damage"" from shipping and refused to repair it.",Product,
Their customer service is beyond horrible.,Product,
They will do everything possible to deny a warranty claim.,Product,
"If you were to order this tv directly through samsung's website, it'll ship w/in 1-3 business days, but the part that's essential to the tvs functionality takes anywhere from 5-15 business days?",Product,
No problem getting it hooked up but Samsung helped me with the final setup.,Product,
Very kind personnel to work with,Product,
"Created a service request and was called the next morning, the robot-person on the phone asked me to repeat all of the above, it's like they didn't hear the entire story I just told them.",Product,
Then then said they would be closing the service request and sending me an e-mail with troubleshooting steps (literally the same as I had already performed) and I will need to watch my TV on these settings (lvl 7 backlight) for 2-3 WEEKS and then it's MY responsibility to call them back and reference the closed service request ticket.,Product,
Service is absolutely terrible.,Product,
The service was fast and excellent.,Product,
I was listening to Sirius radio and had it on 75 and it was clear and loud for a TV.,Product,
Samsung has the best ever customer service people on their team that I have ever had the pleasure of dealing with!!,Product,
"Had to call customer service for some help, they were not overly friendly.",Product,
The TCL Customer service reps were rather clipped in response to questions.,Product,
I spent hours on the phone with their customer service who immediately placed the blame on my internet service and would not deviate from that script.,Product,
Talking to their customer service it was obvious they were not about to go off their script or have anyone come service the TV.,Product,
I think their customer service is designed to deny any issues and delay any real service calls until the TV is out of warranty.,Product,
I called TCL customer support they told me to check if it was on MUTE .. Of course it was not the TV was broken so i had to return it,Product,
customer service I explained I have work and school and cannot stay home to return it she said okay I will receive a refund but I never received one,Product,
"Customer service, however, was fantastic. Returning my first TV was easy, and I was immediately sent another that works beautifully.",Product,
Set up takes a little while - don't hesitate to call their customer service if you have any issues they were awesome (I wasn't scrolling far enough to see what I needed).,Product,
 had high hopes for this TV after reading the reviews but 5 minutes out of the box i got the base installed and attempted to turn it on to find the remote doesnt work with the shrink wrapped batteries it came with.,Product,
"On my specimen, there is noticeable back-light infiltration, initially in the lower and upper right corners. ",Product,
"Screen will go black, randomly for roughly 5 seconds.",Product,
I would. I have had the tv for less than 6 months and it is torn up.,Product,
"Box was damaged, screen casing (black plastic that holds the tv in place) was damaged. ",Product,
When we turned it on the picture had crazy colored lines across and no image on the screen. ,Product,
The screen was broken.,Product,
That is until I got it home and realized that the TV had white spots on it. ,Product,
"That replacement worked for about 4 hours, then the screen started showing black, horizontal lines moving up and down the screen and gradually became worse until the television wasn't viewable.",Product,
"This television was working for about 24 hours worth of viewing, then the picture faded into bright green and white. Completely unusable.",Product,
Within the first month I was having issues with the video and audio not working. ,Product,
After about a week of that the audio went completely out. I contacted sharp and opened a case. It took them about a month but they sent a TV repair man out to replace the mother board.,Product,
had to return it due to large scratch on the screen,Product,
" I have put it to use just few days ago, and all of a sudden there was no Audio coming out from the TV's internal speakers, when I try to stream content from Netflix, Youtube or any other built in app.",Product,
"TV randomly reboots itself, sometimes a few times in a row",Product,
First issue was that on several streams there were odd green lines flickering on the screen.,Product,
After the third day I started losing sound when switching from Netflix to cable. ,Product,
There is some minor light bleed on the edges and you can see the led light zones on all black screens,Product,
sound making that horrible plastic speaker crackling sound after 45 days making it ineligible for return,Product,
Makes loud popping noises while fast forwarding and randomly freezes even while sound is still on.,Product,
"The plastic frame around the screen does not meet all the way around, leaving a horizontal line of light shining through on the top right screen area",Product,
TV sometime has no volume. No idea what is happening,Product,
I got a defective screen that I didn't notice until I saw an all white or mostly light grey screen and now I notice it all the time. ,Product,
Second tv came in and the screen is entirely busted!,Product,
Arrived broken.,Product,
Remote buttons could have been bigger.,Product,
Better viewing angles would be nice.,Product,
Setup experience needs to be improved.,Product,
Needs more audio output ports.,Product,
A better way needs to exist for mounting this on the wall.,Product,
Why does this TV not come with WiFi?,Product,
A larger display would have been better,Product,
The setup instructions could have been clearer and less confusing.,Product,
The TV should be lighter than it currently is so that it is easier to mount,Product,
It should learn my favorite channels over time.,Product,
Great TV but would really benefit from a sturdier base.,Product,
If this TV had more apps I'd pay so much more for it.,Product,
I wish it had actual buttons on the screen to control it.,Product,
The remote should be made bigger since it's too easily lost right now.,Product,
Remote design needs to be more intuitive,Product,
More color options would be great.,Product,
A thinner bezel would make this the complete package.,Product,
I wish they offered this in 4K resolution.,Product,
Adding bluetooth connectivity would be amazing!,Product,
Being able to control this from my phone would be a great feature.,Product,
A thinner screen would be nice.,Product,
A better way to change display settings that is faster and more intuitive would be a huge bonus.,Product,
Different screen modes for gaming vs. movies vs. everyday TV would be a nice addition,Product,
Customer service being done by a person instead of a robot would have made the experience 100 times better.,Product,
The tv has really weak sound to begin with and you have to adjust it when switching from tv to other devices.,Product,
volume control sucks,Product,
 The stand consists of two flmsy plastic legs that are very likely to break off,Product,
the color on this model and the ability to adjust it leaves much to be desired.,Product,
"The built in Wi-Fi was poor,",Product,
Horrible audio quality,Product,
Poorly made. WiFi card is not grounded/will not connect to your wireless and there is no ethernet port to bypass this issue. ,Product,
"This TV is awesome its easy to assemble and has very good audio,",Product,
